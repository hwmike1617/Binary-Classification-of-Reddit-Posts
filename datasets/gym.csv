I still look like an ice cream cone. I posted here a month with the second picture and literally nothing has changed. I’ve been strict with my diet. I weigh 156 now and been getting at least 180 grams of protein a day. I wanted at least make them smaller for my Hawaii trip in April. This sucks.,0

"My house burned down and it’s my fault.My house burned down and it’s my fault I couldn’t stop it. So it was early in the morning, I just woke up and I was in the living room, I saw smoke coming from under a door, my stepdads sister had an old mini fridge inside and left it closed, the mini fridge sparked and it caught the curtain, when I opened it up there was a fire and all I did was wake up my siblings and get out of the house, I didn’t even think about stopping it, the thing is that there was a fire in that same house before and my stepdad stopped it, so if an actual man was in that house years of hard work wouldn’t have burned away. What’s even the point of pretending to be man by going to the gym even tho I’m just some loser, I honestly wanted to go to the gym to be a man but when faced with an actual situation I didn’t do shit, over 7000 dollars in damages and years of hard work on trophies and certificates just for it all to be lost to some loser who couldn’t react.",0
"I workout and eat less and seem to gain weight?I (20F) have been working out for several years. First just following youtube videos, then pilates, now hotworx. I haven’t had a super consistent or even great diet for a lot of it but I feel like now at least I’m trying to eat better/portion control. I also bust my ass in the gym. I’ve always been overweight but not really “obese” and i’ve literally been ordering larger sized jeans and can’t fit in to them? Like it almost seems like I’m gaining weight? I don’t eat the absolute greatest but I eat decent and workout hard 5 days of the week so why does it almost seem like I’m gaining weight. Very unmotivating tbh:/",0

"Finding motivationHi, i’m a 27 (M) currently at 123kg(271.1lbs) and 181cm(5.11), i’ve been struggling with being over weight all my life. I was the chubby kid that turned into morbid obese during teens. At one point in my life when I was 20 I was weighing around 153kg(337lbs) that’s when based on some health and social issues I decided that it was time to lose weight. So over a year and a half of dieting and doing gym and other sports activites I lost 58kg(127.8lbs). I have to say that at that time I was still in college and I had more time on my hands. Fast forward to when I was 22 I moved to another country for work and that’s when all of the old bad habits of binge eating and drinking and not doing any sport activity started again. So over the last 5 years i’ve gained weight again(not proud) and I can’t find that motivation I had 6 - 7 years ago to start again. I was wondering if any of you have any tips or tricks that could help getting that motivation again. I’m a male nurse in case any of you are wondering.",0

"10 week gym progress - 195lbs to 182 lbs (Losing fat main goal)&#x200B;

[Gym Progress \(January 10-March 16, 2023\)](https://preview.redd.it/s5ef6utfb6oa1.jpg?width=2976&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b1b4ae0311b8b3169f63412252535cc5a165c340)

Hi there. Upon showing a friend some of my results, I figured maybe posting it online here would inspire me as well as others to keep going to achieve our goals. I'm nowhere near a physique that I desire (I've struggled all my life with lower back fat, love handles, moobs and belly fat) so until I eliminate those fat stores from my body, I won't be 100 percent content. However, I was sick all this week which threw a monkey wrench into my workout routine. I've decided to eat at maintence calorie levels for a few days, until I heal from this cold. I decided to take another picture and was quite shocked at what I saw. The scale has only moved about 13 pounds (more like 10, since my initial 195 readout was with pants and shirt on) but I'm seeing more progress than that number alone.

&#x200B;

Back in 2020, I was on a medication called seroquel for sleep. This caused my BMR most likely to tank a bit lower than usual, spiked my hunger hormones, and I got into a bad habit of eating sugar like no tomorrow. I was straight up addicted. every day after work, I'd hit the convenience store, grab a couple bags of candy, a milk shake, a slice of pizza and go on my way. I knew at some point it would have to stop. I ended up gaining weight up to 227 pounds that year, and as a result, I became super depressed, body dysmorphic, lazy, and quite frankly empty. I have little to no pictures of me for at least a year or 2 after this time because I was so ashamed. Thanks to my job I was able to lose a decent amount of that, but a lot of the fat was still on me good (it still is even as I'm typing this)

Last August, I decided to get off Seroquel after being on it for almost 5 years. I was determined to fight this weight gain, and my metabolic changes, and give up pills for good to become who I was before them. I knew it wouldn't be easy, but I still pushed through. There have been days where I want to stop, but as we all know nothing comes easy and since most of us have suffered from being overweight, we know what it's like to be body dysmorphic, discontent, and feel intense guilt about the way we eat.

&#x200B;

So in January, I started counting my calories. Not only that, but I eliminated all refined sugars from my diet (for the most part). I focused on increased protein, increased fiber, moderate carbs and fats. The key for me so far, is quest bars and protein shakes. You can make them (albeit with artificial sweetener sometimes) almost as good as you could make a regular milk shake. Protein ice cream, and substitution methods to still relatively be able to eat what I want to sometimes. I spent my hours at work (I work as a custodian) informing myself about nutrition, listening to Greg Doucette, Thomas DeLauer, Andrew Hubermann, and generally anything that I could use to inform and rewire my brain on Nutrition. For me, I decided to keep my protein as lean as possible, but focusing on Lean cuts of beef, chicken breast, whole eggs, ground turkey, and keeping my carbs to MOSTLY complex carbs only, and rotating between vegetables like Brocolli, Cauliflower, and green beans. I don't restrict myself insanely, I still kinda have some grub here and there, but I'm extremely calorie aware now. This really is a whole new way of life I've learned and I have the community to thank for it. Anyways, I won't ramble on here anymore, as I still have a long way to go removing my love handles and belly which is my dreaded genetic doom. I will be posting in another 10-12 weeks to hold myself accountable and to inspire myself to keep going and to never give up. I understand that I'm far from where  I want to be but I was relatively shocked at seeing this results since the last couple weeks have been a little skewed from my normal routine.

&#x200B;

FYI, I spend 4 days a week in the gym after work. Doing approximately 40 minutes of lifting, followed by 30 minutes of moderate to intense cardio on the elliptical machine (which I've grown to love so much) No compound lifts yet, just dumbells and basic machines. Chest press, lat pulldown, seated dips, sit ups, weighted lunges, leg press, leg extensions, dumbell press, normal dumbell curls and hammer curls. I haven't seperated days yet, just alternating exercises at random but mostly always focusing on core and chest/arms. plan to learn more in the coming months as well.

&#x200B;

Peace and love to all let's keep killing it! Thanks to all out there that have inspired me as well as others and I hope once I achieve my goals to inspire others too.",0
"Anyone else recently struggled with weight gain? Looking for Advice and AssistanceHello there,

I wanted to reach out to see if anyone else has recently struggled with weight gain. I just can't seem to lose those extra pounds no matter what I do.

I've tried various diets and exercise routines, but nothing has stuck. I've even tried counting calories and macronutrients, but it just makes me feel even more obsessed with food.

I understand that weight gain can be a sensitive subject for many people, but I wanted to see if anyone else was feeling the same way I am. Perhaps we can share some tips or tricks that have worked for us in the past, or simply offer each other some support and encouragement.",0

"The Advantages of Working Out at a Gym vs. at Home"" With so many options for working out these days, deciding whether to go to the gym or work out at home can be difficult. While both have advantages, here are some reasons why working out at a gym may be a better option for you.

Gyms provide access to equipment that you may not have at home, such as free weights, resistance machines, and cardio equipment. This variety of equipment can assist you in targeting different muscle groups and achieving your fitness goals more quickly.

Social interaction - Going to the gym allows you to socialise with other people who are also interested in fitness. This can be inspiring and help to foster a sense of community.

Trained professionals - Many gyms employ personal trainers who can advise you on proper form, design workout plans tailored to your specific goals, and hold you accountable.

Distraction-free environment - While working out at home is convenient, it can also be distracting with pets, children, or other household responsibilities. Going to the gym allows you to concentrate solely on your workout without distractions.

Motivation - Being in a gym environment can be motivating, especially when you see others working hard and achieving their fitness goals. It can also instill a sense of responsibility to push yourself further.

However, there are some advantages to working out at home, such as convenience and scheduling flexibility. It all comes down to personal preference and what works best for your lifestyle and fitness objectives.",0

"I’m really struggling with self-image and “enjoying the process”TLDR; how do you find the motivation and drive to look past where you are (physically) now and not focus on the imperfections and flaws you have in your physique while also doing workouts to improve your physical appearance? (It’s the circular logic thing that bothers me the most)

So, fitness has been a struggle for me my entire life. I’ve always been overweight due to medical complications (genetic, no fault of my own) and it’s been one of those depressing factors that’s weighed (ha) on me for the last 27 years (I’m 27 lol). In the last 5 or so years, I’ve successfully lost and kept off 80lbs of where I was (330lbs at my max), but now that I’m really focused on getting to around 215 - 225 (I’m 6’ 1”), I can’t for the life of me make any consistent progress because I get discouraged or depressed.

About 4 weeks ago, I was in a consistent rhythm with maintaining my diet and exercising 3-4 times a week. It was good, and then life things got complicated and I fell off. I’ve been trying to get back on, but I’ve been stuck feeling sorry for myself (I get it, it’s a waste of time…). I’m starting to get over that, and tonight was the first time I got back to the gym. I was doing legs and doing fine, but then I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and saw how disgusting my midsection looked. It killed my motivation, I finished the workout but now here I sit in my car in the gym’s parking lot, depressed and looking for help.

Thank you for reading this far if you have, really means a lot. But I need help, I need some sort of motivation or support. I feel I’ve exhausted my options, nothings working. Podcasts. Personal Trainer. Therapy. medication. Nothing has gotten me there consistently. I understand I’m wasting time with these worries, but getting to where I want to be also takes a long time if I want to do it in a healthy way. I’m just conflicted and frustrated on many fronts.

"New to the Gym (+Diet)Hi everyone, 

I'm a 20-year-old dude who goes to school full-time and works part-time, so I am usually busy throughout the day. I'm almost done with school, and after turning 20 a couple of months ago, I've realized how much my health matters in terms of maintaining myself, eating a healthy diet, and working out. 

I weigh about 195 pounds and stand at about 5'6. I'm overweight for my gender, age, and height and have a goal of 155-160 pounds. I don't know much about health and fitness, and the internet has been a reasonably informative resource for understanding where to start. 

I'm coming here to ask anyone for advice on what I should buy regarding a food scale and any apps to track macros, supplements, and how you can prioritize meal prepping and working out into a busy schedule. How do you also get a good night's rest to ensure you're keeping yourself well-rested for the rest of the day and a workout sesh?

Walking into this, I was hesitant about making a change, but I'm eager to make a change and see where I can end up in a couple of months.

"how can i get motivated again?I am 16 years old and my height 1.88 m, it has been very difficult to go to the gym for 2 weeks, not only because of going back to school, but also because of the things that rely on me. having friends who started the habit of going to the gym after me and seeing that in such a short time they have progressed more than me has not helped me, on the contrary, it has made me feel that all my efforts have not been useful. I weigh 88kg ( I'm over the weight I should be) and feeling that my routines have become repetitive my motivation has disappeared. The fact of reading a lot doesn't help, it makes me feel that it's better to stay reading than to go to the gym, or also that every time I go to the gym I can get robbed since I'm walking and in my country every corner is dangerous.

"Is there anyone who was tall and skinny/weak who is now a lot bigger who would like to share any tips or their workout routine?I’m 20M 6’4 180 pounds and I am extremely weak. I’ve been working out at the gym the past year and a half and I was seeing progress, but I got hernia surgery 8 weeks ago so I wasn’t able to do any lifting/heavy workouts and it seems like i’m back to where I began. I can barely do 10 push-ups and they aren’t even good push-ups. Also my whole body gets really sore after workouts even on muscle groups I didn’t workout. 

I used to be 6’4 150 so I have made a lot of progress but it seems like all the weight went to my legs, stomach and a little bit in my biceps and outer chest but my forearms, neck, back and inner chest are extremely weak. Even when I did go to the gym before surgery my bench, squat, deadlift, etc were godawful. 

Is there anyone in the same boat or does anyone have any tips/workout plans that could help me? I still have to keep my workouts pretty light for the next 3-4 weeks. Sorry if this is all over the place and a little long I just needed to ask before I forgot.",0

"Thankful from the bullying and surgeries.10 years of lifting (started when i was 16). Thankful for my bullies who body shamed me for being too skinny. Started to lift to gain weight, tried competing in bodybuilding and physique divisions. Worked as a hotelier then got sick, had 2 surgeries and a colostomy bag, had 3 surgeries again and here I am 11 months after my last surgery.

When I arrived at the gym, I was greeted by a friendly staff member who showed me around and explained the various machines and exercises. I was initially overwhelmed, but the staff member was extremely helpful and encouraging. I decided to begin with a simple workout after getting the lay of the land. I began with gentle cardio and gradually increased the intensity. As I progressed through the various machines and exercises, I gradually began to feel more energized. I felt fantastic by the end of the session. I'd worked up a sweat and felt like I'd accomplished something significant. I left the gym energized and motivated, and I've been returning ever since. The gym has become an important part of my life, and I'm grateful that I took the first step and decided to give it a shot. I'm excited to keep going on my journey and see how far I can get!",0

"Dropping weight for formI’ve been going to the gym for about 2 months. 
My form is absolute ass. Bending my back to compensate, tilted to get the lift, terrible. 

I have nerve damage on my right side, so it’s very weak. 
Todays the first day I decided to work on form rather than how much I can lift. 

My mindset was, “the heavier you lift the faster your muscles will build.” 

I dropped about 20lbs-30lbs on each side (arms) because I lift different weights for each side due to the nerve damage.  
After dropping all that weight and focusing on form, I swear this was the most painful, best feeling workout I’ve had since I started. 

I’m not well versed on weight lifting, the science behind muscle building, etc. but I will say I feel 100x better today than I have in two months. 

If you needed a sign to drop weight and focus on form, this is it. 
Fuck what other people think, focus on you, king or queen.

"Resources for female beginner gymgoerHi folks,

my lady friend is looking into starting a routine and I would like to assist her by providing some resources.

Since she has never been doing any gym strength/ hypertrophy type of training we have started easy with full body training 2x per week and I am at least assisting her with making sure her form while doing exercises is proper in order to a) benefit from the exercise b) to avoid any injury.

Anyways, will continue for another \~2x weeks with the initial introduction to training, but then she would definitely like to have a more attested proper routine. 

Is anyone able to assist with good resources for women beginners at a gym? Doesn't matter if it's reddit/ youtube/ Instagram/ literature. The point is she would like to look into such resources, but frankly, it was even hard for me to find some coherent resources that would be easily digestible, especially for female gym newbies. Ideally, she'd be working out \~ 3x times per week in the gym hence if someone has a good routine specifically for females that would be great.

Thanks,  y'all!",0

"Working out saved me from a former life of severe anxietyBefore I start, I want to emphasize the significance of consulting your doctor before making any decisions related to your mental well-being or medication. 

I was always a shy kid. The kind of kid that avoided making eye contact and rarely spoke unless spoken to. As I grew older, my shyness turned into something much more debilitating. I evolved into someone who was consumed by darkness that robbed me of my ability to live a normal life.

During this period I didn't know much about mental health and it was tough for me to talk about my thoughts and feelings. I was scared that people would make fun of me or think I was weak. I didn't want anyone to judge me and think I was broken.

In 2006, at the age of 13, I was dealt a crushing blow when I was diagnosed with a cruel quartet of mental health struggles: severe anxiety, body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and depression. These debilitating conditions made each day an unbearable burden, every moment a suffocating struggle, every social interaction a source of terror, leaving me feeling helpless, alone, and desperate for a way out.

This is where the “Medication Trials” start.

Over the course of 14 years I was on and off many different medications such as Prozac, Zoloft, Trazodone, Celexa, Paxil, Effexor, Cymbalta, Remeron, Lorazepam, amongst approximately 10-15 more but these were the ones I remember at first thought. 

The meds seemed more like a band-aid fix rather than a real solution, as I was never able to fully shake off what I was feeling. Majority of them made me feel very high, sleepy, increased suicidal thoughts and many of them had the same side effect of giving me blurred vision, which was super annoying to deal with. I also tried Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) but didn’t notice much help after I would leave the sessions. 

At this time I was constantly searching for something that would make me feel normal again. While watching old bodybuilding documentaries on YouTube, I felt a spark of inspiration igniting within me. It was as if my engine was revving, eagerly waiting for me to push down on the gas pedal and take action.

In that moment I realized that what I was feeling inside stemmed from me not being happy with the way my body looked. I wasn’t able to pull back the curtain of my thoughts far enough to realize that this was the root of my problems. This is very different from a Doctor telling you a diagnosis, to you actually fully realizing this yourself, an “Ah-Hah moment”.

This is where things change.

I started doing 100 pushups - 4 sets of 20 each morning, along with doing bicep curls with some resistance bands I had purchased online before I showered and ate breakfast. I did this for the next 3 months, 5 days a week, while taking the weekends off to rest. I also started to be conscious of the foods I put in this machine of a body. Let's get real here, a big part of how our body looks like is from what we eat/drink. If you had your dream car, say a Lamborghini for example, would you fill it up with the worst type of gas? Or would you want to fill it up with the best gas to make sure it’s running at full capacity. Think of your body this way and you’ll be more aware of what you put into it.

After 3 months I started to get some compliments here and there from family members that I haven’t seen awhile. They noticed that my arms were leaner, my face was more slender, my double chin was now a single chin, and my beer belly gut was a lot smaller. This was the first time in a long time that I didn’t feel like I wanted to die anymore. Hope was growing inside of me.

After 6 months, I noticed an improvement in my mental and physical health. However, I still felt anxious about joining my local gym and started to feel like my usual workouts weren't as effective as they once were. Seeking a solution, I turned to Google for inspiration and stumbled upon a piece of fitness equipment that caught my attention. It was a water-filled bag with colored dye, promising a workout experience like no other. Intrigued by the Google ad, I ordered the fitness bag.

When the fitness bag arrived, I filled it with water, added dye, and pumped it up with air using the included pump. Eager to try it out, I attempted walking lunges with the bag positioned on the back of my shoulders - an exercise I had seen others do with this particular fitness bag.

The first set was a bit shaky due to the water moving back and forth in the bag, but I quickly adapted and completed four sets. The sensation was unique and left my legs feeling wobbly, which was a great feeling that I hadn't experienced with my usual workouts. The ever-shifting weight distribution in the bag made each step challenging and unpredictable, providing a stimulating workout experience.

After incorporating the bag and resistance bands into my workouts, I was able to do a full-body routine that included deadlifts, chest press, shoulder press, lunges, bicep curls, and tricep extensions. This piece of equipment not only helped me to sculpt my physique but also enabled me to perform exercises that I otherwise couldn't do at home.

At the 1-year mark, the mental health issues I was dealing with had dramatically decreased to the point where I could join my local gym, and I did. I continued working out there for the next year and became good friends with the manager there. He saw my progress over time and actually offered to get me certified as a personal trainer if I would work at his gym. I gladly accepted the offer and still work evenings there till this day.

After two years of exercising regularly, I felt great! So, with my doctor's approval, I started to taper down my medication. At first, I had trouble sleeping and my appetite was a bit off, but things got better after a few weeks. Being disciplined with my workout and eating regimen helped to keep me on track during those weeks.

Now, I've been into fitness for just over three years and it has truly saved and changed my life. I'm in control and don't let my thoughts and emotions hold me back from doing what I want, I push through them. It's been a year since I stopped taking medication and my doctor has noticed how much better I feel mentally and physically. She even asked me to start training her at my gym.

I used to have a lot of negative thoughts about how I looked, which made me feel anxious and depressed all the time. But now, I can look in the mirror and feel happy with what I see. I'm so much more confident than I used to be.

My body dysmorphic disorder made it hard for me to spend time with my loved ones and do things that most people find enjoyable. But now, I'm hardly ever at home because I love going out and doing things like taking walks in my neighborhood. It's the little things that bring me the most joy.

My Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) was related to my Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), and I used to feel the need to touch and check my stomach fat many times a day. But now, thanks to my body transformation, those obsessive thoughts and actions no longer exist within me.

I felt like the depression was the outcome of dealing with my other three mental health issues. I used to struggle with suicidal thoughts, getting out of bed in the morning, had low energy, constant fatigue, poor eating habits, and negative self-talk. But now, I can't wait to start my day with a fresh perspective. My energy levels are pretty high throughout the day, my eating habits have improved, and I no longer suffer from suicidal thoughts and negative self-talk.

After 14 years of dealing with severe anxiety, I was finally able to break free from the mentally suffocating chains that held me hostage. I no longer suffer from severe anxiety, body dysmorphic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression. I lost 63lbs and now have a body that I’m so happy and proud of.

If you're someone who is struggling with any kind of mental health issue, then getting into fitness may be a viable option for you. Please note that I am not suggesting that the method I used will necessarily cure your condition.

And for those looking to start working out at home, these 2 pieces of equipment genuinely helped me out and I hope they do the same for you:

Resistance bands - [https://fitfanatics.co/products/fitness-resistance-bands](https://fitfanatics.co/products/fitness-resistance-bands)

Just remember that however you are currently thinking and feeling at this moment can be changed if you’re not happy with it. Remember that the tough days prepare you for the good ones, and in the end the good days always outweigh the bad ones. Know that you ARE truly amazing, you ARE beautiful, and you CAN be anything or anyone you want to be. Visualize your end result and put in the work to make it come true.

"I'm just happier than I've ever beenToday I Deadlifted 140kg and yesterday I squatted 110kg. I know it isn't anything massive, but Im so happy that I'm slowly approaching the goals I set for myself when I started hitting the gym 1 year back. I dont have many people in my life who I'd tell this to and would understand and care, so I just wanted to tell someone that im getting stronger and leaner. 

Im slowly approaching the combined (DL + Squat + Bench) 450kg goal I have, and I want to believe in myself that I can hit that by the end of this year.

"How to get my gym crush to talk to me?Hi,

Im just a girl whos been going to the gym. Lately theres a guy whos been coming to my gym alot more recently, he's still a skinny guy (looks like he weighs around 62kg and hes probabaly 1.75m tall) he isn't really big or tall but he is good looking  and hes making some awesome gains

Definitely decent :)

I think he seems a bit unconfident because some of the guys are bigger than him 

Anyway we havent had any eye contact or anything but i keep trying to get him to notice me and he doesn't pay attention which is frustrating so to him i probably just look angry all the time, even tho im just trying to look cute 

So I just don't know what to do, why cant he just talk to me? Is it cause he diesnt think hes different or attractive? He doesnt even waste all his money on unnecessary fancy pro gym clothes or anything so maybe he thinks i wont want to talk to him while he wears normal clothes. 


So idk what to do, my thoughts are waiting for him to get bigger til he has the confidence to ask for my number, but idk if he has a gf or where he's even from so i dont want to ask him unless he gives me a reason first

Do y'all have any tips?

Thanks yall",0

Ive been hitting the gym more recently but Im still a skinny guy. I weigh 62kg and I am 1.75m

Lol maybe I am decent 🤷🏻‍♂️
But yet I dont feel confident and there are lots of more guys that are bigger and better looking than me…

So there is that girl Ive been noticing recently that I think looks pretty cute. We aint had no eye contact or something like that and she always looks kinda annoyed or stressed. 

So I just dont know what to do I cant just talk to her. I dont even look attractive or diffrent apart from other I actually just look like a normal amateur guy. Dont even have this pro gym clothes or shit.

So idk what to do. My thought is maybe getting bigger and than asking for her number or some shit. I dont even know if she got a bf or where she from. 🤔

"Encountered my first gym bully todayIm 17(M) from South Africa and today i got bullied by 2 older men and one of them is an officer which makes it more sad. I was dead lifting with my friend and these 2 bullies came up and asked if we were using the squat bar holder (idk what its called) to which i responded no, they came over and completely took over the place and didn't bother to ask if they could use it they did their own thing. We had to wait and we were frustrated but we still kept cool. 10 minutes passed and they're done using the squat rack but haven't bothered to take of the weights or put the bar away to which i got annoyed rightfully so. Time passes and i attempt 140kg deadlift to which i fell flat on my ass loll, and behind me were the same two guys laughing and commenting on me. 

Long story short though the rest of my 1½ hour session they carry on laughing and describing how i failed to their friends and even the staff, all laughed and looked my way. It got to the point where they lied and said i wanted to do legs (which i wasn't) but instead i sat by my friends and they described it as being scared. The one making all of these comments and laughing is a police officer, big fat egotistical asshole. In honestly unphased by what he's doing but ik that its going to stay in my mind for a long time.

I might confront him on Monday and hopefully be on good terms, but i have no hope as he's twice my width and about 6'1 ( im 5'11). Next week i will pick up that 140kg deadlift because those two assholes have done nothing but make me want to try harder and work harder to prove them wrong. Idk how to handle something like this because i know about nothing will be done about it because complaining to management does about nothing and they're accomplices in laughing at me which saddens me. Nonetheless im not sure how to block something like this out my head, im hoping someone can help me get over this and maybe how/if i should speak to this guy. I say im unphased but i know deep down that im upset and angry but rest assure next week that deadlift is going up.",0

"Gym enthusiasts, what’s the best method to my situation as different people give completely opposite answers, I don’t know which one is right for me?I’m a 21 yr old female. 5’ 3” 48.9kg last I checked a month ish back. 

I’m looking to get myself in better shape and to gain muscle on my arms, shoulders, chest and belly. 

In terms of how active I am outside of exercising at home. Where I currently work we regularly lift 15-30kg at least once a week, I could probably lift a little heavier but due to the shape of the items I carry at work and my body size it’s a little awkward to hold. So I’m terms of activity at least one day a week i lift about 15kg about 45-80 times in the space of 30-40 minutes. And the rest of the week I lift that weight occasionally during my shift if needed. I don’t really walk much, but I do walk once or twice a week for an hour. So in terms of major activities, that’s pretty much it. 

Im looking to see if I can create an effective weekly schedule based off what exercises I should do for the areas I want, how many times and for how long.
If anybody is able to help me form a schedule for now until I improve. If I can get enough motivation to continue I may consider joining a gym but if I can start at home first and see how it goes that would be great. 

Another thing. People online talk about diet all the time and everybody is giving different answers such as eating lots of junk is fine and some say eating junk isn’t fine. I would like to know what nutrients I should be lowering and what nutrients I should be increasing and by how much based off my body description? 

I really want to push myself, but of course I don’t wanna make a schedule that’s going to over do it and make me unwell. 

At home the only equipment I have is dumbell/bar bells but I know there’s a lot I can do without much equipment.

"I wanna be naturally strongHey all,
I really want to be strong and fit again. I'm young so I have time to build up strength, but I have a couple of barriers:

- I barely have enough time to get household tasks done, such as cleaning and cooking. I have ADHD so its a hard balance. 

- I struggle with food/eating. Again, ADHD. The meds make it REALLY hard to eat. I'm regularly dipping into ketosis because I didn't eat properly. Which /sounds/ good on paper, but I am constantly fatigued and weak. I would like to gain more weight. 

- Price. Gyms are expensive. I am worried about commitment, especially when I am probably going to commit work/home over a gym. I don't want to commit to something I might not do. 

- I don't know HOW to gain strength/muscles. I don't know what workouts are good or how to do them, especially with my goals in mind. I like lifting exercises, they feel good. But I don't know what to do.

Am I doing something wrong?I've been working out for a few months and I'm not feeling any better than when I started. I'm not feeling the addictive side of it at all. When I'm going to the gym I'm dragging my feet the whole way and when I'm there I'm just trying to get it done so I can go. And it shows because I'm not making much progress in terms of my physique. The only reason I'm doing it is because I want to experience being big and strong for once. I've been really skinny and really fat but never big and strong. But I honestly feel like giving it up completely. Am I doing something wrong or something? Why aren't I feeling it the way other people do?,0
Help in generalSo Hello first of all I don't now if that is the right place to post this but here goes nothing so yea I basicly started working out about a month ago and it does feel nice but there's something about the exercises I do that youst Feels wrong or I don't know if I even do the right exercises for the right muscle group so if any kind souls out there would be nice enough to help me out here I would realy appreciate it,0

Im 20 y/o, weigh 195 and have a body fat % of 18. According to an online calorie deficit calculator, to hit my goal It says i should eat about 1868 calories a day. It seems low to me but my body has already adjusted to the lower calorie intake to the point i find it difficult to eat more then that a day. but my biggest concern is that it seems like i hit a plateau or something. my goal is to hit 185, im at 195 now and started at around 210lbs.",0

"I never lifted 100kg in bench pressSomething that's been bugging me for many years, is how casual guys online make it seem to lift 100kg or 225lbs. It's like the new 50kg, or something. Is it like a basic US standard, because most people where I go never lift that much. It's only less than a handful of guys, far as I know.

And I know I ""shouldn't"" look at other people to compare, but at some point it just grinds on you. You've been doing something for many years, and all these guys can do it, you start wondering if someting is wrong with you. I feel like it's biting me in the ass from time to time, and that I'll never be truly strong unless I do that.

"How breaking my phone addiction helped me reach my fitness goals 

Like most people today, I’ve been completely addicted to my phone for several years. I used to think it wasn’t that big of a deal, but after reading the research on the health impacts, I started to make an effort to cut back on my usage.

After putting in some hard work I’ve gone from 7+hours to <1 hour per day and I can definitively say that it has had the single biggest impact on my ability to achieve my fitness goals since I started to hit the gym.

After looking into the research, I realized the impact is twofold: 1) It greatly increases the efficiency of my workout. What I used to do in 1.5 hrs I can now do in 50 minutes because I’m not scrolling social media between every set. 2) Doomscrolling zaps you of all your motivation by overstimulating you with dopamine. Once you’re overstimulated, tasks that are normally enjoyable but that don't elicit as much dopamine (i.e. weightlifting) become much less attractive. It made me workout more ENJOYABLE.

Reducing screen time isn’t easy, but I experimented with dozens of tips/tricks to help. Below are the 7 most helpful tips I’ve implemented to help me stay off my phone:

&#x200B;

1. **Don’t sleep with your phone - delay use as late as possible.** Our addiction to dopamine largely resets overnight, meaning we \*\*\*\*have the most self-control when we wake up. Don’t immediately lose the day by scrolling on your phone.
2. **Delete all social media/doomscrolling apps.** You don’t have to delete your accounts, but force yourself to use these apps on your computer (if at all). This makes using these apps more intentional.
3. **Find a good screen time app.** App blockers never worked for me, that’s why I use [Present](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1644737181?pt=125390894&ct=redditgymmotivation&mt=8) which motivates you to stay off your phone by turning it into a game, but there are countless others out there. Find one that works for you.
4. **Increase distance between yourself and your phone whenever possible.** Leave your phone in another room, turn your phone off, etc. Anything you can do that increases the effort to access your phone will condition you to stop checking
5. **Turn your phone to grayscale mode (black and white).** Apps intentionally use pretty colors to get us to look at them. If you turn everything to black and white, suddenly your phone becomes more boring. How to: Settings>Accessibility>Display & Text>Color Filters>Grayscale
6. **Turn off all non-human notifications.** Do you really need dozens of notifications from Domino’s letting you know that Hawaiian Pizza is trending in your area?? No! Make it a habit to turn off all these automated notifications that are designed to distract
7. **Figure out what you want to do with all your extra time.** This one might be the most important. Tell yourself WHY you actually want to reduce your screen time and what you’re going to be able to accomplish. If you don’t tie reducing screen time to your goals then you’ll fall right back into your old habits eventually",0

"Today was my first time at the gym!Technically i’ve gone once before but i was too scared to do anything out of my comfort zone so i just stuck with the treadmill which i have at home. But today, i decided to get to working on my upper body. I’ve been using my treadmill for about 30 minutes a day at this point so i needed to step it up. I got to the gym and warmed for about 15 minutes on the treadmill and elliptical, I stretched and all that at home. Then i tried out 6 different machines which i have never done before, all working out my chest, arms, shoulders, and back. I made sure to push myself enough to feel the burning sensation and man it was tough. I’m a little out of shape, i have a lot of chest and belly fat that i wanna get rid of or turn into muscle. I was at the gym for about an hour and I feel great. I did 3 sets of 12 for each machine and after each set i just felt so empowered. I’m planning to come here 3 days a week to work out my core, upper body and legs, and the days i don’t come i’ll do cardio at home. I think i’m gonna take the weekends for rest days for now. And i’m gonna try to be eating better because my bad eating habits is why i’m where i’m at now. I’ve been meaning to take this step for a while now and today i did it! I’m hoping I can finally be comfortable in my body soon. Anyways i felt pretty proud of getting out of my comfort zone today and wanted to share with someone. Any suggestions on eating habits or exercises for a beginner like me?",0
BULKING MOTIVATION,0
"I just witnessed the most inspiring thing I’ve ever seen in a gym.I’m in awe right now.
I’m at the gym, hitting a solid leg day, and I’m working on some calf raises. I noticed a thin, skin & bones, older gentleman wearing a marines t-shirt tucked into cargo shorts walking toward the leg machine area. Almost knee high socks, reebok’s from 1960. You get the picture.
Dude walks up to the leg press machine I just got off of. Mind you, I’m 6’3, 220lbs so I’m lifting relatively heavy. Homeboy literally takes the weight and runs it all the way down to the bottom. As in, literal max weight.
Homeboy throws his legs up (and I’m sitting there looking at how scrawny yet muscular his legs were, like no fkn way does this dude even move this weight an inch) gives it a little flex and the weights jump, then back down to resting position.
I’m like :O
It’s like he was just calibrating before he pushed for real.
He then flexes his legs, lets out an old man grunt, and proceeds to throw up a set of five, perfect form, leg presses like it’s 50lbs.
I’m looking around the gym like holy shit is anybody seeing this right now?!?!?!!!
At this point, I’m shitting bricks.
He gets off the rack, looks over at me with my fucking jaw dropped on the floor, nods, and waddles off to the other side of the gym.
I’m just sitting here like bro what did I just witness???? Is that you, Master Roshi?! What kind of absolute machine of a man did I just encounter? 
After I piece together my sanity, I go to look for him in the gym so I could tell him how inspiring he was. Maybe ask his name, what platoon he was in.
He was gone as fast as he came. 
I might not have gotten your name, but I’ll never forget you, sir. Stay hard. Oorah.",0

"How should I (F) trainf arms?After 1 year of going to the gym I see that while I increased the weight A LOT in legs, glutes etc, I didn't have much gains in arms.  At the start even 2 kg/ 4 pounds was heavy for me, now I do it with 4kg/ 8 pounds (I know it is a light weight, but I still get a lot of soreness the next day so I believe it's working). This frustrates me a lot, because it's a really light weight and I want strong arms. 

I doubt if it's because I'm female or the way the trainer made my workout (first legs/glutes then arms/back).

I'm a skinny/skinny fat guy. I started training 8 months ago and every since then I've been eating very well, enough calories, enough carbs, enough protein, and enough natural fats. I've also taken supplements like multivitamin, zinc, and I also tried whey protein over a month or two. I lift heavy weights and get stronger every week. In addition, I'm well informed of how the the human body functions and how to activate the muscles properly with proper form and technique. My technique is flawless in most exercises. To conclude, I tried eccentric failure at first, but then I switched to progressive overload which I've been doing for the last 3 months, and I have gained literally 0 muscle mass. Any ideas?

P.S I'm 191cm at 77kg.",0

"Question: how to get motivated when you work a lot?I work on a fire department schedule, 24 hours on and 48 hours off. Working my regular schedule is fine in terms of me working out but when I get forced overtime, it's hard to find the motivation to do anything. Yesterday I worked a 36hr shift and got home around 9pm. I'm a paramedic and we aren't supposed to touch the firefighters' workout equipment, so I can't do my routine while at work. Also, unlike the firefighters, I can't change into shorts and just wear bunker pants over them instead of my duty pants, and working out in my uniform is constricting and uncomfortable and then I'd have to sit in my sweat for the whole shift. The issue is these long 36-48hr shifts where I only get one day off between shifts. I know I need to hit the gym but I've already been away from home for so long that I find it hard to get motivated to go. What's the best way to motivate myself to go? Should I just take my pre-workout and force myself to go?",0

"Nothing amazing but heres my 1 year progess that noone asked for😅One Year since I started working out. on my own, in my garage or garden without a clue what to do. I started with just a bench press and squat rack and slowly build up to a more full gym. I have trained 6 times a week pretty consistently and am happy with my progress so far although I have a long way to go.

I have gained a lot of weight. In the first picture I’m 172 and in this second picture I’m 200, obviously a lot of fat in that too. I know the gains aren’t ground breaking buy I’m happy with the results. Ill pop some measurements below :)

I have definitely gained a lot of fat as well as lean mass but I was dirty bulking so I expected it.

How to Get in the Gym (For ABSOLUTE Beginner) [Advice],0
"Advice: Don’t Encouraging Senior Citizen to go to the GymHi, so I just wanted to get some advice for how to help my mum out. So, she’s 
64 female, and has osteopenia, high blood pressure and have Morton’s neuromas (2 left foot and 1 right foot plus major scarring due to post-procedure complications from removing another one). 
She want to loss weight (about 5-8kg) but mostly focuses on on-and-off dieting with minimal exercise such as walking but even that is hard for her due to her  feet issues, and it really breaks my heart when I see how stressed out she is, while always doing other things for other people like my dad even when she doesn’t really want to (like his taxes on top of her own etc.). And dieting not great as it really doesn’t let you keep the weight off, and she’s struggling like she’d say she’s skipping dinner but then I see her snacking on a kit Kat a minute later.
Plus I know resistance training can reverse her osteopenia from progressing further with having to take shots with side effects.

So, what do you recommend for personal/small group training sessions, while encouraging them to go to the gym to portentously 2-4 days per week but not massively aggravate their health issues.

P.s if you have any medical knowledge or experience in anything I’ve mentioned in this post above then I would be very appreciative if you could comment on this post. But anyone else is welcome to comment to in their personal advice for this sort of situation.

"Should I cut my bulk short?I've been bulking for the past 6 or 7 weeks and so far I've went from 150 to 162.

"How to get the ""Feelgood"" feeling that everyone always talks about?As the title suggests - I've intermittently tried to get into working out for probably the best part of 10 years (I'm now 27, male), however I pretty much always leave the gym feeling far worse off than if I hadn't gone at all. I just don't feel like I get any ""feel good"" hormones from working out and I'm unsure if theres a solution to this? I've been trying to do some cardio as I've never been athletic and understand the importance of heart health and having a healthy mind etc, this is something I've been struggling with so I've also tried to get into weight training too but this doesn't seem to be hitting the spot so to speak either. I just feel like it makes me feel down after I've had a workout, I'm unsure if this is confidence or something else.
 
A bit of background - I was pretty underwright going through teenage years until around 23 years old when I suddenly put on a fair amount of fat which led me to becoming slightly overweight which has persisted since (I'm currently a BMI of 26, I know I'm not terribly overweight however I could do with addressing this). I've recently gone through a breakup after a long term relationship which has brought back some depression and anxiety which I've always had but it's peaked due to various reasons. I've felt like now is the best time to try and focus on my self. The breakup partly had to do with me not being happy with myself and not addressing this in a proper way and feeling a little hopeless at the time. I also work from home all week, usually around 60 hours or so (A rather stressful job) and have no day to day requirement to actually move out of my office chair.
 
Has anyone else experianced anything like this and if so, how did you overcome it? I'm really keen to try and improve myself both mentally and physically (I think when you breakup with someone you finally see what they have seen for so long and realise it's time to make a change).

"How to lose weight without harm to health Today, it has been convincingly proven that excess body weight is a guarantee, if not the development of type 2 diabetes, then at least the occurrence of health problems that reduce life expectancy by 10 years or more. Therefore, an increasing number of people of all ages have questions - how to lose weight without harm to health, and is it possible to lose weight quickly? Suppose you approach the solution to this problem persistently, purposefully, systematically, and comprehensively. In that case, it will not take long from the bland ""I want to lose weight"" to the proud ""I am the owner of a toned figure.""

* Losing weight the right way is not as easy as doing it right
* Healthy weight loss begins with determining your inherited body type and metabolism (rate of metabolic processes):

**Ectomorph.**

Tall people with long limbs, narrow and flat chests, long faces, and high foreheads. A fast metabolism prevents him from being too fat, but if this happens, the ectomorph will have no problem with how quickly he loses weight. Extra pounds will go away easily and quickly, but then he will have a long process of pumping up long and sinewy muscles.

**Mesomorph.**

A medium to tall man of athletic build, with broad shoulders, a narrow waist, and naturally muscular limbs. The metabolic rate of the mesomorph can be both high and low. In the latter case, how to lose weight in a mesomorph is an urgent issue since excess fat is deposited very quickly and is burned extremely hard and slowly.

**Endomorph.**

Medium or short person, with broad elbows/knees and narrow wrists/ankles, naturally weak limb musculature. A slow metabolism makes gaining extra pounds fast, and losing weight quickly is practically unsolvable. An endomorph should look for the answer to how to gradually lose weight and prepare for the fact that it will be incredibly difficult to do this.

After determining your own body type, which will dictate to a particular person how to lose weight correctly, namely the specific dietary principles and training scheme that helps to lose weight without harm, you should clarify whether everything is in order with the health of the endocrine system because its pathologies can prevent weight loss in principle.

Women need to remember that a change in the balance of sex hormones due to age - entering the premenopausal period, or due to the presence of gynecological disease, for example, polycystic ovaries or endometriosis, without special correction and treatment, in principle, makes it impossible to lose weight. The health of the male genital area, although much less common, can also dictate the conditions for getting rid of extra pounds stored in fat depots.

**Proper nutrition is an important factor in proper weight loss**

The first recommendation on how to lose weight without harm to health is to change your eating behavior and limit the calorie content of the menu. By how much should you cut calories? It depends on physical activity (recommendations are below, in the Calculation of calorie intake and expenditure section).

Regarding changing eating behavior, today, for weight loss, doctors recommend either the KETO (ketogenic) diet with BJU%: 15/80/5 or the Mediterranean diet with BJU%: 50/35/15 and the rejection of simple sugars. In how to lose weight without harm to health, the Mediterranean diet is preferable, as it has no contraindications and is recommended by WHO as a therapeutic nutrition system for diabetes and other diseases of the endocrine system.

In addition to choosing a type of diet and correctly calculating the necessary daily calorie restriction depending on the planned physical activity, for safe weight loss, depending on the type of physique and metabolic rate, when compiling an individual version of the dietary diet, one should adhere to the following recommendations:

Ectomorphs - do not exclude fatty meats and dairy products from the menu; enrich the diet with avocados, nuts, peanuts, and peanut butter ;

mesomorphs - include in the menu one or more multi-purpose supplements for active longevity, snack on protein bars with a minimum carbohydrate content;

endomorphs - avoid hungry days, reduce calories minimally, divide the daily diet into 6-7 portions of equal volume and calorie content, do not eat fast food and street food, be sure to eat fiber-rich vegetables and lean meat/fish every day, including an Omega supplement in the diet -3, eliminate any alcohol;

for women with an altered background of sex hormones - a 6-month intake of a drug based on red clover or common prune;

for everyone - supplements: fat burner, β-alanine, tryptophan, a complex of vitamins of group B + C + E.

In addition, regardless of the type of physique and the type of diet chosen, following the intermittent fasting regimen with the 16:8 algorithm is recommended - you can eat only for 8 hours during daylight hours and drink only water for the remaining 16 hours. Please note juices, sodas, and alcohol are included in the food.

**How to lose weight quickly without harm: necessary physical activity**

Safe weight loss and the formation of a toned figure are impossible without cardio and strength training. Even the WHO has changed the requirements for maintaining health through exercise. Today is a mandatory load:

* morning joint warm-up-charging;
* evening hitch;

Strength and cardio training 3 times a week for 2 hours or 5 times a week for 1 hour, while cardio loads should be more intense than walking at a calm pace.

For those interested in how to lose weight quickly without harm to health, we clarify that 1-hour cardio loads should be done before the first breakfast. The start of combined (cardio and strength) 2-hour workouts should be planned at 19:00. Also, for healthy weight loss, it is extremely important to follow the gradual increase in load. This applies to all parameters - the duration of the training, the number of exercises repetitions, and the load's intensity.

When choosing a type of cardio load, it mustn't cause negative emotions. With strength exercises, everything is much easier. And exercises with weights (with free weights or on weight machines) rather quickly, in 2-3 weeks, will begin to deliver both moral and physical pleasure, both during their performance and at the end of the workout.

**Brief recommendations on the training regimen for weight loss depending on body type**

Here's how to lose weight properly, ectomorph. Categorically do not engage in separate cardio loads. They should be high-intensity, last 10 to 20 minutes, and be performed exclusively after the strength part of the workout. First, you need to do squats and then load the arms and shoulder girdle muscles. Ectomorph should be practiced 3 times a week. Weight loading should be moderate but high frequency.

Here are tips on how to quickly lose weight mesomorph. It would help if you did exercises with weights 3 times a week according to methods with progressive overload. You must finish your strength training with a 10-minute, moderate-intensity cardio session. Also, the mesomorph needs two 1-hour cardio workouts, which should be done in the morning (before breakfast) on the days between the 1st and 2nd and between the 2nd and 3rd strength training.

But specific recommendations to help you properly and effectively lose weight for an endomorph:

strength training - 2 times a week with exercises for the upper body + 2 times a week with a load on the bottom: each exercise is performed 10 to 15 times, in 3 sets with pauses between them of 50-60 seconds;

* cardio training - 4 times a week.
* What exercise to do at home cleaning

During the COVID-19 pandemic, when everyone was forced to self-isolate for a long time, which made the necessary measurements of energy costs during house cleaning and was urged to pay attention to this type of physical activity as a load that can help in the correct, safe weight loss.

In addition, you can benefit and give an additional load on certain muscle groups, making your figure even more toned and attractive if you perform some gymnastic movements during cleaning. Here are some examples:

When moving objects from one surface to another, for example, when carrying flower pots from a windowsill to a table, roll from the right side lunge to the left and back, controlling the verticality of the spine.

**Sweep the floor with a strongly drawn-in stomach and tense abdominal muscles.**

While washing the floor with a mop, at regular intervals, for example, after 15 seconds, lower the mop by the shoulders onto the shoulder blades, and after a deep breath, on a long exhale, 4 smooth turns of the torso to the right and left.

When washing walls, do not move in horizontally, but in a vertical plane, with alternate squats on the right/left knee.

If you need to stand on a chair to clean the house, then before doing the necessary cleaning action, repeat the steps-ascents / descents 5 times with the right and 5 times with the left foot. Repeat them after the end of the necessary cleaning.

Helps with weight loss and stretching. When wiping the mirror surfaces near the floor, be in a deep side lunge, periodically rolling from the left foot to the right and back.

Include cleaning the floor with 2 rags with 2 hands on your knees, periodically stretching your back. To do this, move from the position: sitting with your buttocks on your heels, chest pressed to your hips, arms extended, palms pressed to the floor - into position: emphasis bending on your knees. The exercise Kitty will not be superfluous for weight loss: in an emphasis in a kneeling stand - round and bend your back, look at the ""tail"" through the left and over the right shoulder, bending the spine in the lateral plane.

At the end of cleaning, applaud yourself for 1–1.5 minutes. Such movements stimulate the work of all internal organs. Circular movements of the fists clockwise and counterclockwise will help to relax the strained wrists. Cleaning should be completed in 30–60 seconds in the position: of lying on your back with your knees pressed to your chest, held by your hands.

Separately, we emphasize that house cleaning is an unplanned load on the musculoskeletal system, making it impossible to control the moments of muscle tension and relaxation, thereby causing their enslavement.

Including rhythmically repetitive movements in cleaning allows you to avoid this, get health benefits from any cleaning, and spend a little more energy than facilitate losing or maintaining body weight within normal limits.

**Calculation of caloric intake and cost**

Of course, it should be remembered that any rapid and gradual weight loss is possible only if it is low in calories - when calorie consumption exceeds their intake. Therefore, the calorie content of the daily menu should be carefully calculated depending on the physical activity and training planned for a particular day.

How to lose weight - calorie consumption (in 5 minutes):

* articular morning exercises - 20;
* complexes of intensive gymnastic exercise -38;
* heavy physical labor - 47-60;
* construction work - 32;
* light work standing - 15-20;
* sitting office work - 9;
* digging beds, manual pruning of trees - 27;
* planting/weeding/watering/harvesting - 26/19/9/18
* driving a car - 12;
* general house cleaning/dusting, plumbing, vacuum cleaner - 20/18;
* walking at a slow and calm pace - 16 and 23;
* jogging in place/motion/off-road — 47/41/53;
* running 5 min/km - 73;
* running 3.4 min/km - 105;
* running up and down stairs - 75/45;
* training on an elliptical trainer - 43;
* jumping rope slowly / quickly - 47/70;
* swimming/scuba diving/water aerobics - 15-35 / 70 / 44;
* riding an exercise bike, hours - 210-540;
* tae-bo / shaping/aerobics/ashtanga yoga / static yoga - 41/23/30/35/19;
* interval training - 47;
* training on power simulators - 43–60;
* stretching - 11;
* dancing - from 17 to 62;
* evening hitch - 18;
* sexual activity - from 6 to 9;
* sleep (8 hours) - 50.

On average and minimally, men who will exercise while losing weight according to the schemes proposed above will spend about 3,000 kcal per day, and women - 2,800 kcal.

For weight loss to be gradual, you need to spend 200-450 kcal more consumption, and to quickly lose excess body weight, energy costs between intake and consumption should be 500-700 units.

**How to sleep while losing weight**

Many complain: I don't overeat, I train, but I don't lose weight. The reason for this stupor may be a lack of sleep. It is no coincidence that in the list of tips on how to lose weight correctly, there is a recommendation to sleep 8 hours a day so that the time from 00:00 to 3:30 is for sleep. It is at this time that the body produces hormonal substances that, to a greater or lesser extent, take part in metabolic processes and affect the regulation of body weight - the hunger hormone ghrelin, the satiety hormone leptin, the growth hormone somatotropin, melatonin, T3 and T4, male testosterone and female estrogen, FSH and LH.

Moreover, it would help if you slept in the dark. Light, especially rays of the blue spectrum, entering the retina through closed eyelids inhibits the production of melatonin, one of the regulators of the synthesis of the hormones listed above.

And the importance of sleeping 7-8 hours a day is evidenced by the proven fact that with a 6-hour sleep duration, the stress hormone cortisol doubles, and it, in turn, doubles the production of the hunger hormone ghrelin.

For those who comply with all the conditions necessary for weight loss, the normalization of sleep will help intensify the weight loss process and overcome the weight plateau after 3-4 nights. Special sports nutrition supplements will help you fall asleep and sleep for 8 hours without waking up.

**Water balance control: an important factor for weight loss**

All experts have long agreed that a person must drink enough clean water, especially losing weight. The debate is about its quantity.

Some nutritionists argue that it should be dosed in ml per kg of body weight per day. This is 55% of 25 ml/kg/day for people with normal body weight. For overweight people who do not plan to lose weight - this is 65% of 30 ml per day per 1 kg of ideal, not actual body weight (BMI). For those who lose weight, this is 70% of 40 ml/kg BMI / day, where BMI \\u003d actual weight in kg: (height in m x height in m). For example, with a weight of 75 kg and a height of 172 cm, the BMI is calculated by the formula - 75: (1.72 x 1.72).

Other experts suggest using a fixed minimum amount of clean water per day, depending on height and weight - from 1.5 to 2.4 liters (in portions of 150-220 ml, at approximately equal intervals of time).

Many doctors and nutritionists insist that you need to drink still table water, depending on the strength of the manifestation of a feeling of thirst.

To lose weight without harm to health, you should adhere to the new findings obtained as a result of several dozen medical studies conducted in Europe, the USA, and Canada:

**The recommended amount of table still water for losing weight:**

* men — 3.7 l/day;
* women - 2.7 l / day;
* in the hot season with a low % of air humidity, the rate of water consumption can be increased by 2 times;
* When using fat-burning complexes, supplements containing caffeine and vitamin C, and other sports nutrition products with a diuretic effect, the daily volume of water should also be increased by 0.5–1 liter.

In addition, when answering the question of how to lose weight correctly without harming health, it should be clarified that during this period, however, and after, shortly, namely 5–10 minutes before a meal or snack, you should drink a glass of water. 

Water will not dilute the gastric juice and will not become an obstacle to digestion. At the same time, such an action will help some learn to distinguish thirst from hunger and control the feeling of satiety, and some, not all, but many will contribute to a faster breakdown of food.

**How to lose weight: drinking regimen for losing weight during training**

Recommendations for weight loss on additional (+ to the daily allowance) water intake during training from the doctors of the US College of Sports Medicine:

* 90-120 minutes before the start of the workout, you should drink 500 ml of still table water - in 2 doses (after 10 minutes).
* In training with loads of medium intensity:
* in 60 minutes - 220 ml;
* during class - 5-6 sips every 15 minutes.

During high-intensity training, physical exertion in the fresh air during the heat and low humidity, or training lasting 90-120 minutes, you should drink not pure still water but Regidron solution - 1 tbsp for 500 ml of water. The number of sips increases to 7-8, and the time between drinking episodes is reduced to 7-10 minutes.

It is better to drink 8% glucose solution or sports isotonic during general endurance training, even during weight loss.

After training, the first glass of water should be drunk immediately, and the second - after 10 minutes. If the thirst does not go away, then after another 10 minutes, a third glass of water is drunk.

During the week that precedes menstruation, fluid intake during the day should be reduced by 10% - not 2.7 liters, but 2.5 liters, but at the same time follow all the recommendations regarding the drinking regimen during training.

We also clarify that the refusal to drink water during both cardio and strength training reduces the effectiveness of the training process by 10%.

**Principles of simple weight loss without harm to health**

In conclusion, here is a list of errors in following the principles of how to lose weight quickly and without harm to health, which 100% will prevent you from getting rid of excess fat reserves:

Regular episodes of overeating interspersed with fast days and popular diets that lack nutritional peer review. Abuse of alcohol, sweet soda, stored juices, fast food, and street food, foods with a high glycemic index.

* Sedentary lifestyle. There needs to be a systematic approach and the right choice of training scheme. Violation of the principle of a gradual increase in cardio and power loads. Ignoring holidays required for recovery.
* Incorrect Calculation of calorie intake and expenditure.
* Constant lack of sleep and violation of the rules of healthy sleep.
* And the last mistake in how to lose weight without compromising health, which today has been proven not only by experience but also by medical randomized clinical trials, is the restriction of water balance and the lack of consumption of clean drinking water.

**Conclusion**

Only adherence to the basic principles of how to lose weight will help you lose weight quickly and without harm to your health and will not allow extra pounds to return, nullifying all efforts. The key to the success of safe weight loss, and then the stable maintenance of normal body weight and maintaining its physical condition lies not in short-term measures, but in a long-term, at least one year, change in eating behavior, daily routine and lifestyle, as well as in the constant rejection of bad habits, conscientious treatment of chronic pathologies and responsible attitude to one's health.",0

"Is this a good progression(1year)I am 19yrs old, currently 92kg(started gym at 74kg), having 4300 calories a day(bulking). I have seen many 1 year transformation vids and it seems so many people have made way better progress in their first year than I have. Like their chest had developed way more than mine has for example. I have been going gym 5 days a week with weekends as my rest days. Since the start of the year I have been doing PPLPP then sat/Sun rest days. I try to do 5 chest exercises a session(twice a week)as it’s the main part I really want to progress on at the moment, 2 heavy compound movements(3x6-9), 2 moderate fly movements(3x12) and then finish with an incline plated machine press to failure(2 sets). I have gained weight(18kg) and my strength is increasing slowly each week but in terms of mainly chest growth(as it’s my priority right now) I feel like mine isn’t developing as quickly as other people. Am I doing something wrong with the way I train? Or is this an average amount of progress for a year? Any tips on best ways to grow out your chest and overall look more aesthetic.",0

"ADVICE ON SHAPING BODYHi! I for the longest time have been really skinny (never weighed above 120 LBS) 
Recently I went onto a binge eating phase where I decided to eat anything and everything to see how much & how fast I could gain weight. 

So I’ve gained some blubber on my body which I am so happy I was capable of doing. 
My booty is fatter, but so is my stomach. 
I used to consistently go to the gym (not a pro) but cardio was my main thing. Along with usual machine work outs to keep the body toned. 

I’m looking to keep the nice fat on my body but also shape it & essentially make my stomach slimmer

Any advice the type of workouts I should be focusing on to tone the stomach without losing the meat on my bones & becoming skinny again?",0

"Have been away from the gym because of surgery.it's been 2 months, and I've lost a lot.  But finally made it back yesterday.    I had to take it easy but I was able to hit the back and arms.    God I have lost a lot in the biceps.   Doing only 20 lbs curls and failing with low reps.  (biceps were always weak for me.  don't know why).

It was hard to motivate myself to go back.  But I told myself that i'll take it easy at first since I dont want to rip anything apart (stitches etc).     Sometimes I find that if I have a hard time going to the gym I'll just tell myself ""i'll just do under an hour"".    Then I can at least get INTO the gym.   and then the next few days it's easier to get in there and do long workouts.

"Issues with the effect of creatine usageFor a while now, I’ve used creatine as preworkout, but with a bit dissapointing effects. I don’t really feel more energized during my workout, except my pump is a bit more intense. 

I’ve heard that the effect varies between creatine products, but idk if that’s true. As my product seems pretty a bit crappy relative to from other companies. A factor too might be that my preworkout expired almost a year ago (assuming creatine expiring isn’t a myth).

And I don’t use anything else at the gym, not even caffeine, so it’s not a tolerance issue I would assume. What do you think could be the issue?",0

I think by this time I at least should see a minor change but I don’t, I’m just done with this man I’ll probably cancel my subscription soon.",0

"How to Stay Motivated at the Gym: Tips and Tricks 

**Are you struggling to stay motivated and consistent with your workouts? It's normal to feel demotivated or lose focus, especially if you've been following the same routine for a while. But, fear not! With a few tips and tricks, you can stay motivated and on track with your fitness goals.**

&#x200B;

1. **Set achievable goals:** One of the most effective ways to stay motivated is to set specific and achievable goals. For instance, set a goal to increase your bench press by 10 pounds or run an extra mile. Achieving your goals will boost your confidence and give you a sense of accomplishment.
2. **Mix up your routine:** Doing the same routine day in and day out can get boring and demotivating. Mix things up by trying new exercises or classes. You can also change the order of your exercises or switch up the sets and reps to keep things interesting.
3. **Find a workout buddy:** Working out with a friend can make your workout more enjoyable and help you stay accountable. You can motivate each other and challenge each other to push harder.
4. **Use music or podcasts:** Listening to music or podcasts can help you stay motivated and focused during your workout. Create a playlist of your favorite songs or find a podcast that you enjoy listening to.
5. **Track your progress:** Keep track of your progress by taking photos, measuring your body fat percentage, or logging your workouts. Seeing progress will keep you motivated and give you a sense of accomplishment.
6. Reward yourself: Set up a reward system for yourself. For instance, treat yourself to a massage or a new workout outfit when you achieve a specific goal.

**Remember, staying motivated takes effort, but it's worth it. With these tips and tricks, you'll be able to stay motivated and on track with your fitness goals.**",0

"Never give up when life breaks you downHad a 18 month break because of injury,  surgeries and recovery. Lost a lot of gains in that time, but also went down to 12% bodyfat in the last 6 months as a preperation for a lean bulk. I went to the gym for the first time again today and well, I wasn't able to do nearly as much weights as before, finished after only 35 minutes and wasn't even able to complete my whole routine. Felt like almost dead at the end... One of the best days in the past 2 years, maybe my whole life. I missed it all so much I wasn't hyped like this morning since I was a child.

AC separation.Looking for somebody with a similar injury. Even though my AC separation healed to it's max potential my left arm gives out a lot quicker due to the injury.

Been off gyming for 3 months, and wanting to get back into the gym, I struggle cutting calories and have a high fat torso, skinny legs, and toned arms. So with shirt on, look ok, shirt off, high fat. My long term goal is to be around 15% BF but initially focus on getting stronger, and potentially eating slightly more for 6-8 weeks to help get stronger. From their, then begin a long cut. I want to work out 3 x a week, what split would you recommend, and what do people think about my approach? Reason I struggle cutting calories is I already eat around 2200-2500, and any less, my workouts plateau and I cannot for the life of me progress. Help",0

"Top Gym Products to Help You Crush Your Fitness GoalsHey there fitness enthusiasts!

As someone who's spent a lot of time at the gym over the years, I've tried out a ton of different products and gadgets that are designed to help you get the most out of your workouts. Some have been total duds, but there are a few that have become staples in my gym bag. So today, I wanted to share my top picks for gym products that can help you crush your fitness goals!

Wireless headphones: If you're someone who loves listening to music or podcasts while you work out, a good pair of wireless headphones is an absolute game-changer. They allow you to move around freely without getting tangled up in cords, and many models are sweat-proof and water-resistant.

Foam roller: If you're serious about fitness, you probably know that recovery is just as important as the workout itself. Using a foam roller before and after your workout can help prevent injuries, alleviate soreness, and improve your overall mobility.

Resistance bands: These simple, portable bands are incredibly versatile and can be used to target all sorts of muscle groups. Whether you're looking to add some variety to your workout routine or you're traveling and don't have access to a full gym, resistance bands are a must-have.

Fitness tracker: There are a ton of different fitness trackers on the market these days, ranging from simple pedometers to high-tech watches that can track everything from your heart rate to your sleep patterns. Having a way to monitor your progress and set goals can be a great motivator to keep pushing yourself.

Reusable water bottle: Staying hydrated is crucial when you're working out, and using a reusable water bottle is not only better for the environment, but it can also help you stay accountable to your hydration goals. Plus, many gyms have water fountains or filling stations, so you can refill your bottle throughout your workout.

Of course, there are plenty of other gym products out there that might be useful depending on your specific fitness goals and needs. But in my experience, these five items are must-haves for anyone looking to get the most out of their workouts.

What are your favorite gym products? Let's chat in the comments and share our recommendations!",0
"get embarrassed working out?As in when tryna do certain lifts which will result in funny expressions around the girls in the gym.

Half ROM pullovers aint gonna mess w my gains are they?

Looking for adviseHi all. Started my first gym session on Sunday it is now Wednesday. The outside of my elbows are killing me. Seem like like it’s worse any advice on how long for recovery. The pains real bad 😂,0
AlcoholAvoid or minimize alcohol if possible. Alcohol inhibits protein synthesis and hence interferes with the recovery and body buildup process. It also contains too much calories with low nutritional value that could derail your toning and weight loss ambitions. Keep gyming!,0

"Strip/drop sets count like a single big set or like multiple separate sets in the weekly overall volume?So let's say i do 4 sets of Chest Press using the stripping/drop technyque: i do 6 reps x 4 times, lowering each time the weight by 10kg, with no pause between these 4 sets.

"Advice on pain I am havingHi everyone,
I have been lifting at the gym and for the past few months, when I have been doing exercises (mainly bicep exercises) I get a pain on my forearm bone.

I have looked at compression sleeves but not 100% sure on how how effective they are and what the best one would be.

"Gym Help - Is it normal to get stronger after a week's breakSo since December of 2022, I've been going to the gym 3 time a week 1 day on 1 day off, and up until a week ago never missed a day.

Well, a few days turned into a week, and I returned to the gym. The weights feel so much lighter now. I went from 25 lb to 35 lb dumbells and added 35 lbs to my squat. I did 3 sets of 10 on all my exercises and felt great!

"Advice for weight-loss + muscle gain for someone in the verge of quittingHello everyone, 

I'm 32(f), after weighing myself and seeing I was currently weighting 163 lb (Im 5'3), I decided to make a change and start working out. 

 I've been going to the gym for 2 months from M-F every morning, and wasn't expecting many results so far, but yesterday I weighted myself and apparently I've gained 3lb in these past few months. 

Not going to lie, that has taken all my motivation away, and I'm currently at loss into how to move forward, or if it is even worth doing anything at all.  

My routine is very basic, on day ""A"" I do excercises for my arms and core with dumbells or doing planks for about an hour and afterwards I take a 30 min zumba class. On day ""B"" I generally work on my legs and lower back, and afterwards again the 30min zumba class. 

Regarding nutrition, generally I try to take care of what I eat during the week and try to avoid having dinner, as I tend to eat more during that time of day and I cannot diggest well at night. Weekends are a little harder, as I tend to go have an occasional dinner/drink. 

Is there something I'm doing wrong or that I could improve? Talked today to a friend that is going to a nutritionist which told her that if she wanted to gain muscle she had to stop doing zumba completely, which was super weird to hear. Currently I'm using all my spare cash to pay for my gym membership, so going to a doctor is not an option at the time, does anyone has any advice into how to procceed?

Thanks!",0
