"Why is pigeon pose so painful?Hi! I'm just getting back into yoga after not practicing for 6ish months, and noticing some significant pain in my hamstring when attempting pigeon pose. I am able to do the pose on my right side with no problem (just the intended stretching sensation), even the threaded variation, but when I switch over to my left side, I can barely stand holding the pose with my chest fully upright because I get an intense jolt of pain in my left hamstring. It does not feel like the usual discomfort that comes with building up flexibility. Has anybody else experienced this? Is it a sign of something more serious? Are there any stretches I could do that might make the pose possible by warming up my hamstrings more? Any advice you have would be so appreciated :))",1
"Mexico all-inclusive with good yoga?Does anyone have any experience with the yoga offered at all-inclusive resorts in Mexico? I love the idea of a yoga retreat, but my kids are very young so it doesn’t really work for my partner and me right now. We are on the hunt for a Mexican all-inclusive that is both kid friendly and offers high quality yoga classes (e.g. great instructors, nice setting). It would be ideal if classes were offered multiple times per day so we can switch off with the kids if needed. I know there are several resorts that offer yoga (along with other fitness classes) so I’m really looking for input from those of you who have experienced it. Thanks in advance!",1
"Weight into the fingers.My wrists hurt like crazy whenever I'm doing downward dog, plank, chaturanga, etc. I know the weight should be going into the fingers not the wrist, but I found that impossible. My arms and legs are not that strong, but I know when I'm doing the positions right cause I feel relief... that doesn't happen with my hands/wrists :(

How can I become more self aware of my fingers and make them strong? How can I practice the pressing into my fingers part?",1
"I’m lonely as far as healthy communication and belonging to a community or group of friendsI’m a 26 yo gay male in the Houston Texas area who lacks normal human connection and really wants to find somewhere I can go to feel comfortable sometimes and connect with individuals who may possibly like the same thing I do. I like art, cars, self care, healthy friendship, coffee, reading/learning, parks/outdoors. I really want to try yoga as I am trying to calm my anxiety and become more mindful but I don’t have anyone to go with and I have major anxiety about going to a yoga class on my own. I really want to find healthy friends does anyone have any advice? Thank you for your thoughts!",1

"Down dog app and front splitsJust started my stretching journey and just trying to be healthier overall, and I get the Down Dog app for free with my Uni email. In addition to just basic, all-around flexibility, would the app end up being enough to eventually get me into front or middle splits?

"ChatGPT made up a yoga pose?I am using ChatGPT to learn yoga. Has anyone heard of the pose described here: 

The Otter Pose is a Kundalini Yoga posture that is said to help stimulate creativity, increase intuition, and enhance focus. To do this pose:

* Sit on your heels with your knees slightly apart and your hands resting on your thighs.
* Slowly lean forward and place your forearms on the ground in front of you, keeping your elbows directly under your shoulders.
* Spread your fingers wide and press your palms firmly into the ground.
* Relax your head and neck, and breathe deeply.
* Stay in this pose for several breaths, then release and come back to a seated position.",1
"Coming to the end of 200 hour training.I’m coming to the final weekend and graduation of 200 hour training. I know that what we’ve learned only scratches the surface of all that there is to learn if this practice. We are always learning and evolving until we are no longer. I’m feeling both worn down, and also at the same time, so grateful and proud. But I do feel mentally and physically worn out. Like I want to just go off the grid for a few days and be alone with my thoughts and mat and a few books to recharge. I feel so much stronger physically during classes, and I have much less anxiety. Two major wins from all of this. Have any of you felt this sort of depletion at the end of training, and if so what did you do about it? I think once we have it graduation ceremony, I will try to meditate more and focus on my own practice at home for awhile to recharge. Curious to see if anyone’s ever  felt this way.",1
"Advice on pacing home practiceI regularly attend yoga classes and started to do yoga on my own at home. I was able to create flows that I like and can remember the sequence but I can’t seem to pace myself, I move through the poses too quickly.

"Hot yogaRecently signed up for an unlimited membership at my local hot yoga class! I’m hoping to go around 4 times a week, including before and right after work, I have some questions for seasoned hot yoga go-ers

1) any tips for a quick turn around from sweaty AF to office? I’ll have about 45 mins to get ready, there are showers and hair dryers there, but I think it will take a while for me to stop sweating from when I’ve been to those classes before!
2) how often do you wash your hair? At the minute I wash my hair around twice a week and it loves it, but I always want to wash my hair when it’s sweaty because it looks mega greasy. Does it work to just rinse my hair? Or blow dry the sweat out? Get a headband? 
3) any advice on top things to buy, like a yoga towel for my mat? Anything else?
4) any top tips for someone going from occasional hot yoga to 4 times a week?

Thanks all!

EDIT:
5) sometimes I get itchy skin after hot yoga, anyone else get that/ any tips to help if I’m ramping it up? Thanks!",1

Shaking when i do yoga?Hello! so i’ve been doing yoga for about 7 years now and no matter how much i stretch or gain strength i’m always shaking. Doing sun sals when i go from half way lift to mountain pose i’ll shake the whole way up and the whole way down… i’m not trying super hard. it’s almost like my whole body has a tremor?

"Info on Root Board/Yoga boardDoes anyone own a Root Board or similar yoga board for carpet practice?  Looking for opinions on the affect it has versus mat straight on carpet.  I tend to ignore my mat over the weekend because I go M-F at a studio and it's all wood floors.  At home it's all carpet and my forearms always feel sore after practice on carpet.

"Question about balance in crow pose I've been practicing yoga for two years now and I have the strength for crow pose. I've done it before and when I can find the right position I can hold it for about a minute.

The problem here is that the asana isn't stable. The hardest part of it for me is finding the right balance. When it's in the middle of a flow I can't balance fast enough and if I fall out of it, it's usually because my weight goes too forward and I end up feeling some wrist pain. Now I'm afraid of injuring myself in the pose even though I love it. Does anyone have any tips on how to solve this?",1
"Frog Pose - Hip Pain / DiscomfortI've recently started doing yoga a few times a week (just 15 minutes or so to start) and I can't tell if I have really tight hips or if it's just....the way I am

For example doing a frog pose, it's like my legs want to come insards. If they're more inward, I can feel like an actual stretch, but if they're perfectly in a straight line (or god forbid I try to move my legs farther outwards) I get this major discomfort in my hips. And I can't tell if they're tight or if my body just doesn't/can't move that way. 

Another example, I have been doing this one 10 minute yoga video with Kassandra on youtube, and there is this one exercise she calls threading the needle with a gate pose, where one leg is extended all the way out, I get the same 'discomfort', and my opposite legs wants to come inwards, same as the frog pose.

Does this sound like tight hips or could this just be the way my hips are don't allow me to do some of these positions? Hope that makes sense...",1

And this time I wont try to quitIn the past, i did yoga on and off, but Ive been doing yoga since the beginning of this year (75 days consecutively to be exact) Tomorrow I have an job interview where they want me to do a presentation about my previous work (fingers crossed! 🤞🏻) Therefore I prioritized my presentation and worked on it. However I was feeling really sluggish and unmotivated. Turns out, it was a withdrawal syndrome haha.😄 I decided to take a break and wore my comfy clothes and did my practice.

"Question about back bendsI used to do hot yoga regularly until about three years ago when I developed some pain that we had a very difficult time identifying.  It turned out after almost a year of doctor appointments, emergency visits, physio and chiropractic visits and anything else I could think of, I finally got a diagnosis.

Cancer in my spine, and a few other (bone only) places.  (My original cancer diagnosis was back in 2002, so I guess that made it harder to diagnose).  But also discovered that I was diagnosed 7 years ago with osteoporosis, but for some reason, my doctor didn’t tell me.

Now that my pain is finally under control, I have started doing yoga again, but my physiotherapist has advised me that while she strongly encourages me to do this, I must be very careful not to do back bends.  (Although, one of her prescribed exercises for me is cat/cow, which seems like a back bend to me.). So maybe she just meant standing back bends.  I am not sure if this is because of the osteoporosis, or the cancerous lesions in my spine, or both.

So in class, when a back bend comes along, I try to follow along as well as I can while not actually going into a back bend.  My osteoporosis probably dates back over 20 years when they first put me on estrogen blockers, it’s pretty common I think.  And I fractured a rib walking the dog last year, so I think it might be somewhat advanced.

But because back bends happen so much in yoga, I wondered if anyone knew any good strategies for figuring out alternate movements.  I’m worried it could be distracting if I start doing something completely different than everyone else.

I really don’t like to bring attention to myself in a crowded class and honestly, the instructor needs to pay attention to everybody, not just me. But I also don’t want to injure myself.",1

"struggling with seeing improvements in flexibility?I practice daily following YouTube videos. Usually videos by Kassandra. They’re great and I adore my practice. But I feel like I don’t see much improvement over the past year in my flexibility. 

I DO see improvements with some strength, but it’s minimal and I still cannot do any new poses from when i was a beginner. 

Should I be doing a variety of practices focusing on different parts of my body each day? Because right now I just do whatever feels best for me at the time. I don’t have a set schedule of what I work on each day of the week. Which is great for my , but I guess its not helping me get the goals I want of flexibility. 

Please don’t say it’ll come in time. I know it’s true but I really am looking for advice on how I can change up my practice to be more helpful with flexibility and core strength. My hips and spine have the least amount of flexibility from what I’ve noticed. 

Thank you!!",1

"How to protect wrist in yoga practiseHi all! I've been practising gentle yoga for a few years now, but I have regular issues with my right wrist (gangliones, pain, limited mobility). I've already seen a bunch of doctors and physiotherapists, and have done nearly every possible examination (RTG, USG, MRI). My wrist is much better now, but I am still not quite sure on how should I position my wrists while practising yoga.

Oftentimes I can see that other yogis are only touching the ground with their palm and fingertips, with middle part of their fingers lifted. Does it help? How should I position my palm - should it just lay flat on the ground? Where do you put your weight - is majority of it on the wrist, or do you try to spead it evenly across the entire hand?

I would highly appreciate your advise!",1
"Yoga for Back PainSorry for the long post I’m just a little sad about this today. I’ve had chronic back pain for about three years now, two years ago I was seeing doctors, PT, chiros but I was still at least a 5/10 pain every single day and it was really negatively impacting my life. A little over a year ago I started doing yoga four times a week and managed to get my pain down to a 1/10 or some days even no pain! The problem is whenever I stop I feel I lose all my progress, for example I was sick the past two weeks and I’m finally feeling better but my pain is back up to a 3 or 4/10 for the past couple of days and it’s been really demoralizing. Does anyone else have this happen? My pain is super localized to one vertebrae just above my pelvis and feels similar to an aching muscle. It doesn’t move down my legs but hamstring stretching does make it hurt worse, I used to be very flexible (splits and could palm the floor) but I haven’t been able to go below calves in a while.",1

"Chaturanga Dandasana | ""Four-Limbed Staff Pose""Chaturanga is hard. However, it is a core pose in Yoga (all variances), and I wanted to share a little bit of my insights to help you get a little bit better in it.

I'll try to keep it short and informative, feel free to ask questions.

Chaturanga is actually a low plank, so the base pose is:

* Shoulders should be slightly ahead of your wrists
* Come onto the ball of your feet
* Lower your body with control until your elbows are at 90 degrees, no more, no less.

Why is it hard?

* A lot of core muscles are involved. Other than handstands / headstands, this is one of the most complex upper body poses in Yoga.
* In the end, it's both a plank, and a push-up (especially if you continue to upward-loooking dog -> downard-looking dog flow).

How to improve your Chaturanga with variations:

* Preform the Chaturanga with knees down: Less weight to be dealing with until your arms get stronger. Pose os more important than raising your knees: make sure you stick to these 90 degrees with the elbows.
* Before lowering the body to the actual Chaturanga, pause in a plank position. Make sure your shoulders pass the wrists line. Arms strong, try to push yourself to the skies, this will strengthen your shoulders. Only after a few breathes start the Chaturanga itself.

General tips:

* Usually, Chaturanga is part of a flow - do not cut corners, body should be straight and strong, it's easy to start the upward-looking dog half way into the Chaturanga.
* Breathe.

Hope this will help some of you out there!",1
"“Vinyasa” build/body typeI have been practicing hatha yoga for a while and was discussing my practice with a few seasoned yogis. One of them mentioned in passing that I definitely have a “vinyasa build” and “vinyasa body type”?

I’m just curious what this might’ve meant. I am tall and have a pretty athletic build with strong quads and calves… maybe strong shoulders and biceps? That’s about it!",1

"A Spiritual Experience after Morning AsanaBackground is that for the past couple of weeks my 3 month old has been a lot more fussy and cranky, reaching a head over the past couple of days where she's kept her mom up for days on end, latching badly and hurting her.  I had to use what little time I have for self care for the past couple of days to give her reprieve and rest, and take up the sometimes hours long task of soothing the baby and keeping her asleep.

I finally got to practice this morning after a particularly good night's sleep after days of being woken up by fussing.  Did my routine, made breakfast and lunch for us and cleaned up, fed the cats, then set off doing my Asana practice.  It was getting late so I didn't have much time, but I've been working on my lotus which revealed a big tightness in my left obliques/ribs, which was surprisingly absent despite me no working on it for a couple days.

After a short 20-30 minute session I had to get ready for work.  When I got in the car I started feeling overwhelmed after a thought about past lives that came up.  Usually this overwhelming feeling makes me weep at the beauty of my life and the love I feel, but not this time.  It felt like electricity/tingling in my face, but I had no urge to cry.  I felt another urge, or rather, I was overtaken by one.  I kept muttering ""I am loving awareness"" repeatedly until I could only say ""ohhhhhhhhhhhhh"" for several minutes, until I settled myself by chanting the ubiquitous ""ooooohhhhhmmmm"" deep in my belly.  Suddenly I was filled with deep relaxation and awareness of everything I could see in front of me.  I barely had to move my eyes, it felt like my peripherals were enough.  Not focused on anything, but focused on everything.",1

"Lotus pose - feel it in my knees and ankles, but nothing in my hips?I have been trying to work toward lotus pose.

I can do pigeon and firelog pretty well on both sides, while feeling a nice stretch in my outer hips.

But when I try half lotus (not even lotus yet, just half lotus), I can't figure out how to get it to engage my hips. I genuinely feel *nothing,* no stretch, in my hips when I try to do half lotus. I feel 100% of it in my knees and ankles, which I know isn't right so I end up stopping right away.

Not sure how to progress from here. All the advice I see is to keep practicing hip openers; but I have been practicing the hip openers and it doesn't seem to have any relation to my ability to do lotus, so I'm a little stuck.",1

"Improving arm strength and chaturangaHi!!! Been practicing yoga more recently and can really see the effects it's had on my mobility and flexibility and overall physical ability.

I've never been able to do a push up so my arms have always been weak. I tried doing it with knees down and working up from that, but even that is too difficult to do more than once or twice. Are there any ways in yoga to improve on this or would it just need some separate strength training? thanks !! <3

"Cercivals : most difficult area to stretch?Hi everyone,

I'm a calisthenics & kettlebell enthusiast that started Yoga for mobility and flexibility for approximately 2 months now and I really like it. Made tremendous gains in my hamstring, lower back, shoulders and wrist mobility and very happy with it.

That being said there is an area that I never am able to stretch/release properly and those are the cervicals. Not the neck, the cervicals. So think C4-C5, the vertebraes that is around your upper trapizius. 

I had cervical hernia 4 years ago and happily am did recover from it. But to this day it still bothering me a little and flare up sometimes. 

I had some big workouts last week, upped the size of my bell and also went pretty intense on my pull-ups and an ab exercise called dragon flag. Since then I feel like something is pinched in the cervical area and when I touch the area around my cervical vertebraes I can feel a sharp pain.

So I tried to look for cervical stretches but I can find nothing that really releases it. And I'm asking myself: is this area impossible to ""truly"" stretch ?

If you want to strech your hamstrings just touch your toes, your quads do the bow pose, your psoas pigeon pose, your adductors the frog pose, your lower back the cobra pose, your shoulders do the reverse prayer or camel pose etc. and all are pretty intuitive and **really** works in that you immediately feel it in said area.

I have yet to find such thing for the cervicals. I have seen the child pose, cat cow and downward dog being advised but it honestly doesn't stretch the cervicals near enough. Also so the squat sky reaches but it involves the spine rotation and not the cervicals.

Is there anything really effective to target and stretch the cervical spine?

**TD;LR: want to stretch my cervicals and haven't find anything that works well enough please help me**",1

I've started having issues with my skin this year, lots of random pimples and just very bumpy skin in general. I've never had perfect skin, but only occasional pimples here and there that didn't bother me much. But now my skin has really gotten bad in the past few weeks to an extent that bothers me and I don't know why since I haven't changed anything in my diet or in my skincare routine.

The only thing that's changed is that I've been doing yoga in a studio almost every day since January. So I'm wondering if it could have anything to do with that? Like, sweating, having the face on the mat ecc? I have my own mat, but I guess it's still not the cleanest surface to have your face on.

"One hundred days of yoga and now, neck stiffness.I’m right at a hundred days of yoga, the first time I’ve ever been disciplined enough to consistently practice. Because I’m recovering still from a hysterectomy, I’ve been sticking with mostly gentle, restorative poses. 

Previously, I suffered from chronic neck pain which has improved greatly the last few months. I directly attribute that to my practice, and am so grateful. However, I’ve noticed a new catch in my neck the last few weeks. It’s not painful really, but it is uncomfortable. I’ve dialed it in on the neck stretches but no improvement in the stiffness yet. I don’t think I’m overdoing it but I guess it’s possible? 

Should I see a chiropractor perhaps? Or attend a class and ask the instructor to watch me to see if I’m doing anything damaging? I do have minor scoliosis. Could I be hurting my neck in correct poses because my spine is unequal? 

I’m not looking for medical advice, but I would like to know what people do when their body responds in a weird way. I love my practice and see my self continuing and would love to see what I’m doing incorrectly, if anything. I don’t like the way my neck catches then pops near the skull. Could this be a result of my muscles just finally relaxing?

"Feeling a lot of resistance bending forward in straddle?So I have tight hip adductors. I try to stretch them in poses like straddle and butterfly. I have to sit on a block to keep my low back straight when bending forward into the stretch. I also have a slight lordosis (anterior pelvic tilt).

Here is my question. I feel a lot of resistance when trying to bend forward in these poses. I feel a nice stretch in my legs, no pain. I feel no pain in my back or anywhere else. But I do feel like I can’t physically push my trunk forward very far (like, I can bend maybe 15 degrees forward before my posture starts to crumble). I also feel like I’m using a lot of ab and back strength to hold myself in the forward bend, even at the high angle. Is there anything I can do to improve on this? I know I need to work on the hip adductors, but is there anything I’m missing? I don’t have this issue with other folded poses.

"Update on tight hipflexorsHi,

Recently I created a post discussing a limitation in my mobility of my left hip and a pain I suffer, the post sort of blew up, and thanks to the help of the community many suggestions were given. I have compiled the suggestions to investigate.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/11h5al5/i\_have\_very\_tight\_hip\_flexors\_in\_a\_specific\_area/](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/11h5al5/i_have_very_tight_hip_flexors_in_a_specific_area/)

**Hip flexors need strenghtening** \- although this maybe the case with many, I don't think this is my issue, as the more I stretch I feel there's a point I can't go beyond physically. Also, I have very strong legs generally and I don't seem to have weak hip flexors.

**Strengthening adductors, abductors, and glutes**

workouts for strenghtening:

\- glute band side steps for the outer glute area

\- dead lifts for general leg and lower back Strength

\- squats for all around leg strength

\- Bulgarian split squats again great leg work out

\- weighted lunge great leg work out

\- weighted box step up build big hips

\- calf raises

\- ham strain roll out on exercise ball

\- single leg glute bridge on foam roller

\- hip thrusts for the glutes and hips

\- side plank/oblique crunch for the side core

\- knees to bar or toe taps for the lower core

\- weighted plank for the core

\- low bar squat with a fairly wide base

\- split squats on both sides. you don't even have to do it with weight, or with your back leg raised; just do it on flat ground. it'll also give you an idea which leg is stronger/weaker

\-Clamshells and fire hydrants. With and without resistance bands. 

\- Nordic curls and reverse nordic curls

\- squats and lunges and specific hip exercises 

\- Heavy kettlebell swings 

\- hip bridges 

&#x200B;

**Other explanations:**

are you **hypermobile in your joints**? i have a lot of issues near the same place, and it’s because my joints are really loose and so my muscles are crazy tight because they’re overcompensating. if that’s the case, you really don’t wanna stretch it. you’ll want to strengthen. id find exercises that target those specific muscles. if it is just tightness, pigeon pose may help. but if it’s actually causing you pain, i highly recommend seeing a PT. you have a lot of muscles in that region and without training it’s really difficult to accurately determine the culprit. the PT can perform releases, and they can give you exercises and stretches to do at home. it doesn’t need to be more than a couple of sessions

&#x200B;

**top of the sartorius muscle (is tight)**  \- I believe this is possibly my issue. This needs physical therapy for massaging and dry needling as well as stretching.

&#x200B;

it’s the **head of your femur running into the outside of your pelvis** when it shouldn’t

**femoral acetabular impingement -** Physical exam and x-ray

"Please help me get rid of rubber smell on my mat!!I have a Manduka eKO lite mat that I’ve had for a couple months and have probably used for 25-30 classes. I originally chose the eKO because a yoga teacher at my studio recommended it—I am a super sweaty human and do a lot of heated classes, and my teacher said the eKO was a great option for me so I wouldn’t have to practice with a mat towel every single time because it’s sticky enough that I won’t slip in my sweat.

I cannot ever practice without a mat towel (even for restorative classes) because otherwise the smell sticks to my skin and hair and clothes and it’s overpowering.

As a note, when I do pigeon poses my left hip is about 10x tighter than my right.

Since forward folds are such a crucial part of almost every class, I usually have to take a break for a few weeks before I can back in (no pun intended!), and even then, I'm in danger of another flare from time to time.

"Hips popping in and out of socket during leg crossing movementsHi all. I have this thing happening, don't know if it's normal body anatomy or not. But during certain movements such as figure four, lying leg crossing for hip stretches, or even forward folding. I have to make sure my hips are properly aligned during the movement in a certain way to feel the movement.

For example if I'm lying down staff bent and If I try to put my left over right, I have to align my right hip so that I feel both left and right hips being stretched. This limits my range of motion due to lack of flexibility, but I feel it's the right move I'm making. However, if I'm not ""aligning"" my right hip then my right knee and leg is closer to the left one and I can easier mount the left over the right. But in this position my right hip joint is locked/restricted, such that I couldn't bring right knee to chest from this position. I guess what I'm trying to do make it feel right is from staff bent I try to do inner rotation of the right hip.

Just wanted to see if anyone experiences this, if it's normal or not, if there's anything I need to address how I should do it, what is this named etc.

"Instructors, throw away the scriptInstructors, please stop reading a script. Move beyond the script. Liberate yourself from it.

This is especially for new instructors or those who got trained through some highly programmed brand.

I was lucky enough to get exposed to a variety of teachers, so that I could identify teacher qualities; shared qualities, elementary teaching qualities, advanced teacher qualities, and variance within those categories. I have definitely not been exposed to as many as many of you. But I can definitely see a curve.

A lot of new instructors come off as timid and lacking in confidence or, worse, appearing to operate under immense pressure. Teaching Yoga ought to be your special gift to yourself, not a shitty job. Why fall into routine teaching Yoga. It can be freedom from the repetitive work routine.

Many new instructors appear to be reading a script. They use language that is way to common or similar to other newbie instructors. The language is usually way too gentle or PC. I get it. Crear an atmosphere of no judgement. That doesn’t mean having to sugar coat EVERYTHING or excuse ppl from every exercise like, “or you may choose to opt out of this because you’re not feeling it today…” how many times is it necessary to say that  in a single class?!
Nobody’s keeping score. Nobody’s documenting whether you said what you were supposed to say 1/2 way into the class time. Just teach a good class. Help people stretch, exercise, relieve mental or emotional stress, laugh, and test their limits. You don’t have to say everything you planned to say or teach the way that your instructor taught. Putting in the effort to connect and inspire your class is enough. Forcing a monologue comes of inauthentic and like you’re doing a job. It is a job lol.

"Finding advanced instructionI feel like I am starting to peak out at my studio and I’m not sure where to turn. I have been practicing yoga very consistently for several years now and I would like to keep learning more advanced options but struggle to find any classes that teach anything beyond simple arm balances. I’m craving new moves and the feeling of pushing myself. I can find advanced variations online but worry about just winging it myself and want to avoid injury and bad form. I’ve been trying getting into some aerial acrobatics like Lyra and silks but they are pretty hard on my body. Any advice on how to progress my practice?

"Cannabis Plant and Yoga - Thoughts?I have a question.

In Hinduism, meditation is connected to the deity Shiva, and in the mythology and scripture, he is connected with meditation, yoga and cannabis plant. In some other scriptures, cannabis plant is said to be sacred. Sadhus (ascetics/monks) often smoke cannabis plant.

Yet, other scriptures and people say we should be very careful with weed and it isn't recommended for yoga and meditation. What do you think?",1
"Why do I have to blow my nose every time I practice hot vinyasa?I've really been focusing on my ujjayi breath practice in my hot vinyasa classes recently, but am running into the same issue very practice. Something about the combination of nose breathing and how sweaty I get and my nose gets runny and drippy every single time. This prevents my ujjayi breathing and often causes me to end up sneaking a couple of gulping mouth breaths.

Am I missing something? Is having to stop my flow to blow my nose on a towel once or twice during a practice normal? It feels highly annoying both to me and potentially those practicing around me.",1

Sun salutations, moving from upright to horizontal seems to be the challenge for me.

"Where is your favorite place to practice yoga?Hey everyone,

I've been practicing yoga for a few weeks now and I've always found it interesting how different places can affect your yoga practice. I'm curious to hear from fellow yogis on Reddit about their favorite places to practice.

Do you prefer practicing at home or at a studio? Maybe you love practicing in nature, like a park or beach? Have you tried practicing in unconventional spaces like rooftops or warehouses?

Personally, I find that practicing in a studio with a dedicated instructor helps me stay motivated and focused. However, I also enjoy practicing outside in nature when the weather is nice.

"Can't chaturanga due to a weak elbow...When I was very  small I fell and broke the ball off my left elbow. After a ton of physical therapy I am able to move it and have full range of motion with my arm but my elbow does sit very strange all the time now and my arm has always been weak and would not hold my weight. 

I have started doing yoga at home every day since January and I'm feeling awesome! I can plank with no trouble but I'm having a lot of trouble lowering myself down from the plank pose for chaturanga (I've never been able to do a push up for this reason either, despite being a 100lb small frame gal) I also have some trouble with any pose that asks me to reach my right arm up and support myself with my left arm only

"Teacher didn't balance both sides?I just had a yoga class where the teacher led us through a flow, but didn't flow both sides. She went through both sides the first time, where you hold the poses for calibration. Then when it was time to flow breath-to-movement, she did one side but not the other.  
  
She did this multiple times. The first time, several students switched sides on their own, directly against the teachers instruction. She noticed this. Her response was to offer ""it's okay if you're on the opposite side of what I'm saying, just keep doing the side you are doing."" It was like she didn't even notice she skipped a whole side of the flow.  

The second time she skipped another side, she went straight to inversions. Most other students looked confused, with her skipping yet another side flow, prompting her to say ""it's okay if you don't want to do inversions, but I will demonstrate how you do them."" It was like she noticed the class was confused, but didn't quite grasp why.  

Instead of doing the inversion, I did a summarized version of the flow side she skipped. I value balance, and it made me very uncomfortable to be so lopsided in a class like this. I almost said something before she started the inversion demonstration, but I didn't want to interrupt her. Instead, I just did what I had to so I could find balance in my sides.  

Should I have said something? I've never had an instructor fail to flow both sides of a routine before. I hope I wasn't disruptive, but I felt it was important to stretch both sides of my body equally. Does anyone have any input?",1

"Strange Question About Releasing Tension and IllnessTLDR below. 


First time poster, long time lurker - I have been practicing yoga semi-consistently since 2017 with the last 3 years being much more consistent. In that time I’ve received my 200 HR YTT and I am finishing up my 300 HR training. This is relevant because throughout my studies, I haven’t learned anything about what I’m about to ask. I’m hoping a yoga therapist or Ayurvedic practitioner may be able to help.

In the last year or so I have taken it upon myself to truly feel “unstuck”. I’ve always had an absurd amount of tension in my hips, hamstrings, back, chest and neck and always modified my poses to accommodate my discomfort. Last year I decided I wanted a change and worked with mobility coaches to “unlock” my stiff and tight muscles, ligaments and joints. I’ve seen a lot of progress and I feel like my body mechanics have improved tremendously.

That said, I have had many physical health issues coincide with this training. Namely with the gut, skin and hormones. I’ve started getting eczema flare ups when I never had before, bouts of IBS that are worse than usual and weird neurological and hormonal symptoms. I’ve seen a doctor once and nothing stood out and this week I will be seeing one again about my skin issues (the latest ailment). 

The strange dichotomy though, is that my body feels better than ever. My habits are better than ever. I sleep more, I eat cleaner and I exercise more frequently. I’m gentle with myself when I need to be but regardless, my systems randomly freak out like they’ve become ultra-sensitive. Most flare ups aren’t debilitating, but they are uncomfortable and embarrassing. Sometimes I have to leave public places due to sudden rashes or hives that take over my body.

I know about the emotional release when you stretch but is there a physical counterpart? While unlocking years of trauma-induced tightness, am I releasing a Pandora’s box of physical ailments into my system? I know scientifically that makes no sense but I can’t shake the connection I feel.

Just wondering if anyone knows anything about this or has experienced this themselves. Will it resolve on its own?Should I avoid an eastern medical approach altogether? Thanks.

Edited for TLDR;

*Have been working hard to release years of deep-seated tension but meanwhile many acute auto-immune-like flare ups have occurred simultaneously. Is there a connection? *",1

"Are Chakras Real or Imagined?I saw some people talking about chakras in another post and I thought maybe it should have it's own post.

The first thing to know about chakras is that they are part of the Vedic or Vedanta system. They aren't really a much of a thing in the Yoga Sutras.

I think of chakras as mostly symbolic, but they symbolize something that is real. Take for example the navel chakra. That is the area of the stomach, associated with the form of desire known as hunger, and the home of the gastric fire. Externally, there is a huge amount of energy expended on the production, distribution, preparation, and consumption of food. In that way, it is an energy center in a ~~real~~ tangible sense.

If you go through the chakras you will find similar connections to some form of desire and external expenditure of energy. What does it mean to you as an object of meditation? You decide.",1
"Bed of Nails/Acupressure mat with REAL nailsHello r/yoga, I apologize if I’m posting this in the wrong place, I couldn’t think of anywhere else to ask this.

DISCLAIMER: I am not claiming these mats should be used medically or as a medical device. I simply use them as an augment to meditation/yoga as I personally find they help me. Always consult with a doctor before trying something new to avoid injury.

I’ve used many different acupressure mats for a few years and I have over 10 different brands of mats. Only 1 of them actually “works” for me (Zen Guru brand) and its because the spikes are much longer/sharper than any of the other brands. Unfortunately the company isn’t selling their mats anymore, but I still have 2 that should last me a while (hopefully indefinitely).

That said, I once laid on a custom bed of nails with real deal nails (albeit dull nails) and I found it much more effective for my personal goals.

I can’t seem to find any companies that currently sell a more high-end acupressure mat, that’s not made of cheap cloth, foam, and plastic.

I understand many people make their own, and although it may sound simple, getting every single nail dulled down, ensuring they’re the same length, and precisely attaching the nails to a board at equal lengths apart is precarious and tedious. Results are always uneven surfaces which are uncomfortable to lay on due to lack of uniformity.

I’d gladly pay a premium for a product like this, but they’re very difficult to find. Here’s an example of something I’m looking for (out of stock): https://www.gravity-mind.com/shop/p/t2yc9xvpo0ullkkvsesd9b23mhh8ea

While this product isn’t quite fully a bed of nails, the spikes are made of metal and it appears to be the closest thing I can find. It looks pretty small though, and I have a large back, so not sure if it’d work very well for me.

Do any of you know where I could get a legit bed of nails, or something similar (NOT plastic, metal spikes/nails on wood)?

Or has anyone successfully built a bed of nails that’s uniform and something you use daily/weekly?

Thank you!",1
"Umbilical herniaAny yogies here have an experience with an umbilical hernia? I’ve had one for several years now and plan on repairing it this summer and taking the summer off practicing yoga.

When I do the Pigeon Stretch and I put my Legs at a 90 degree I start when going deep enough a pretty sharp pain going from my glutes like through my whole leg, like a kind of tendon.

"Lower back in the air, help!Hello lovely Reddit users!

For over a month now I've been doing my best to attend yoga classes 2-3 times a week. I am not as flexible and stable during balancing poses as I'd like to be, but I'm slowly, slowly, getting there and I couldn't be happier.

However, during floor asanas (like half boat, etc.), I can't seem to keep my lower back/waist down on the floor. I've heard there's where it's supposed to be? As I result, there's a lot of strain on that part of my body and I can't hold the pose correctly. I used to lift my legs up in a 90 deg and slowly lower them, up to just that moment where I feel like my waist will lift from the floor, but that's still too high up.

"Some things I journaled about while studying Yoga besides Asana.So I made it a goal this year to focus on the Asana necessary to work up to being able to do front splits, side splits and lotus pose.  Alongside this I'm trying to delve more deeply into the philosophical study of Yoga.  As a result I've started to see the logical progression of concepts like Yamas, Niyamas, and how they create the foundation for Asana.

I'm not saying that this is the type of thing that people are doing ""wrong"", like we all need to start at studying Ahimsa before we practice Asana, but on my personal journey I experienced a lot of roadblocks that could've been solved with further study of foundational yoga.  Although I don't think I did this ""wrong"" necessarily since it's Asana that drew me to Yoga in the first place.

As one point, in my Asana practice this year I have, through improper practice, injured myself.  It is clear now that I made the right choice to rest for a week and not continue to wage violence on myself even though the pain was very mild.  This is a foundational concept, to be non-violent to yourself and others.

Hip openers are super beneficial, but done improperly it's really easy to cripple yourself since you are almost always applying force along areas like the knee ligaments, which absolutely should not be stretched.  If you go into Asana without non-violence being an immediate reflex you will mess yourself up.

And going through the other Yamas and Niyamas I see how they all build towards Asana, rather than just being ""other"" Yoga if you catch my drift.  How things like Svadhyaya is used in Asana without necessarily teaching it directly, and how it is built from the Yama and other Niyama.  

And the Niyama of Ishvara Pranidhana seems supremely important to advanced Asana like Padmasana, since it deals with submission to ""higher powers"".  I mean, I'm pretty atheist, but even I can acknowledge there are higher powers, like collective consciousness, compassion and the factors of our birth.  That last part is really important too, since some of us will biologically never be able to do Padmasana, and an acceptance of that if we get there is also Yoga.

Anyway I'm probably wrong about a lot of this but just wanted to share my thoughts.",1

"how to fix anterior pelvic tiltI am revisiting yoga in a more serious sense this year, and my goal is to practice a little bit everyday for the rest of my able-bodied life. I'm still very beginner-level and practice at home with YWA. Recently I have given my posture more attention and noticed I actually have a pretty significant anterior pelvic tilt. It has gotten a bit better since I've gotten back into practicing. Does anyone have any recommendations on how to fix my posture? Poses/flows or even videos you would recommend?

"Are There Any WhatsApp, Discord, or other Groups Out There for Sharing Videos and Photos of Our Respective Poses for Feedback/Inspiration?I understand we have the [COMP] section for posting here in order to obtain feedback and/or showcase our skills. I posted there the other day for the first time, and really appreciated the feedback and resources offered by others.   

That being said, I'm just getting started in my yoga journey. To that end, I:

1) Felt a little awkward throwing it out there to a more global audience than say a group of people gathering for a specific purpose of critiquing and benefiting one another. I'm fine with accepting where I'm at, just feel like others views may be a little more polarizing on using the tag for that purpose.


2) Don't really want to detract from the wonderful content I see posted by other users in the [COMP] section that inspire and motivate me to play more and get stronger. 

Do any of you have suggestions for where to find groups that may do something similar to this posts title? I could ask my instructor everything, but I get the feeling they'll start passing me ""join the 200hr YTT!"" cards if I keep the current pace.

"Pigeon pose hip injury?My right hip is slightly more flexible than my left. With my right leg in front, I can easily do pigeon pose with my leg parallel to the top of the mat. With my left, sure I could it, but not as easily. It’s less comfortable - but it never hurts. This is the only part of my body that seems to be really flexible, the external hip rotation. Everything else I can’t do - forward fold, front or side splits, nothing.

So anyway. In classes and at home, I normally hold pigeon pose for no longer than a minute. But this one home video I was doing had me hold the pose for 3 minutes.

An hour later my left hip (maybe gluteus medius?) started to hurt. This was on Thursday, and now today is Monday, still hurts.

How long should I rest? Is this gonna take 1-3 months to heal? I haven’t done yoga for the past 4 days and I miss it so much but I don’t want to make this worse. I have also been going to the gym for the past 5 months and I’m scared to do leg day but I feel like I’m losing all of my progress. :(",1

"Yin yoga and ballet stretchesI am a former ballet dancer who spent years at a performing arts school. Within that culture, it was expected that students would show up a half hour before class started in order to warm up.

Nobody ever taught the stretches, but everyone knew them to be beneficial and practiced them at their own pace. Seated forward folds, straddle stretches (with side and forward folds), forward splits, butterfly, frog… all were usually held for sustained periods. “Breathing into it” seemed natural.  The poses didn’t even have names, you just did them. Students often chatted during this and it was a completely unplanned “session.”This was not part of class but I look back and realize this was done for thirty minutes, twice per day.

I discovered Yin yoga two years ago and I feel like like I’m going back to something I didn’t even think about during those years. The thinking at the time was those were “just warm ups” before a very active class.

I’m not sure why I’m sharing this, I’m just surprised it took me this long to make the connection.",1

"ideas for adjusting for hamstrings tightnessHi all!

I just wanted to ask for any ideas so that I can ease into/adjust for prasarita padottanasana/padangusthasana as well as trikonasana, upavista konasana, etc.

For context, I have been practising yoga more or less consistently for about 4 years. Last September I joined a semi intensive 200YTT which resumed this January. I gained a lot of technique and flexibility but I also think I didn't give my body enough time for rest. Right after finishing the training, getting out of upavista konasana in a guided practise, I felt my left hamstring slightly off. Went to see the doctors and turned out I had pulled my  muscle. Because I am pretty scared of nasty injuries, I took relative rest seriously. After that, I haven't been that consistent since life happened and I have defended my thesis, got a cold, then my yoga instructor got sick, etc. Anyway, I think I unconsciously tense my tight to protect from accidental overstretching, but I am clearly not as strong or flexible as I was by the end of my YTT.

Also for context, I am autistic and yoga is one of special interests, but also one of my go-tos for sensory and emotional regulation. I need this to work. But then again I get extreme meltdowns over the fear of being severely injured as a response to the mildest hint of pain. I guess what I am asking for is reassurance since I know variations that would help, but I don't trust myself enough.

I am in desperate need of better yoga bras to wear as the ones I have now are horrible. I’ve tried going without, but I am rather chesty and don’t find it very comfortable.

"Lethargic for days after yin yogaWhenever I do yin yoga at my studio (as opposed to doing it at home) the effects are REALLY powerful.

"General rules of asanas vs. modern approaches and adjustmentsI've been reading Light On Yoga (Iyengar) and other older yoga instructions. I'm struck by how often they say things like ""you absolutely must keep your knees locked"", while modern texts will often recommend bending the knees. Often, the emphasis also seems to be on a striving towards a certain result (like touching your nose to your knee), whether or not the spine is ""perfectly straight"", which seems to be the #1 priority in more modern asana descriptions.


I've long doubted the modern emphasis on keeping the spine totally straight (after all, isn't it supposed to bend and flex?), and I am now thoroughly confused as to bending knees. But my larger point/question is: Does it matter? 
E.g. Must I feel like I'm doing it wrong if I prefer to feel the stretch in my xyz rather than my hamstrings, at the expense of a straight spine? Or if I like to keep my knees locked? Or if I like to bend them? Aren't all these variations ways of targeting different parts of the body and shifting attention to different aspects of the poses?

I'd like to believe that many ways of practicing asanas are valid, as long as safety is observed. It seems difficult for a lay person to assess what that last part means, though - because of all the contradictory instructions. Presumably, the instructions try to encourage safe practice, but it's often not clear where the danger may lie - and that will surely vary from person to person, too.

Is it OK to listen to my body and ""find what feels good"", rather than try and follow all the contradictory advice? Or is there legitimate scientific evidence behind, e.g. ""bend your knees, don't lock them"" and other modern approaches?",1

"Yoga Studio Policy**I need this community’s thoughts on a recent policy introduced by our favorite yoga studio.**

My wife & I enjoy practicing yoga at this **inclusive studio** 4 mins from our home in Western Washington. This **woman-owned business** has created a thriving community of fitness-loving people because they offer 22 types of classes, listen to participant feedback, and continue to attract **strong female teachers who can lead & inspire**. If someone leaves to have a baby or moves to Austin for the sun, they find an even better instructor to take their place.

Together we have taken over **400 60-min classes** here. My wife even plans to get certified and start teaching yoga this year after striking a friendship with the main owner, a mother of 3 school-going kids.

Last week, my wife attended one of her favorite weekday classes at 11 am. She usually **leaves class 10 mins prior** so she can pick up our 3-year-old from pre-school at 12 pm. She gets her workout in plus picks up the kid on time: **the day is a win for her.** 

However, shortly after the class, our main owner texted my wife letting her know of a new policy - **you are NOT permitted to leave class early.** Even if you inform them ahead of time citing a valid reason. If you must leave early, find another class. No exceptions.

My wife tried reasoning with her - I’ll be whisper quiet when I exit the room; No, this creates a poor experience for others. I can’t leave at noon her school will charge a late fee; Then find another class that works for you. 

She went so far as to use a strawman argument, saying what if 10 clients left the class early - **imagine what kind of disruption that would create!** This is when we decided to stop negotiating.

For a studio that is otherwise very inclusive – heck, they let men bare their hairy chest during camel pose and say nothing to **repeat offenders** who ruin the serenity with their pungent BO – it seems odd they would enforce this rule with an iron fist.

Curious how would you feel in this situation?",1

"Psoas major (the biggest enemy)I finally found out, what is the biggest troublle in my body and probably in most of population.

When I think that I have tight quads, I can just put fingers on quads and check. If I think that I have tight glutes, I just put fingers and check it. The same with lower back, glutes and other muscules.

But there is on muscule that you can not feel it with fingers and you can just feel symptoms and this is psoas major. I put fingers on lower back and feel that is tight like a stone. Then I think: ""Probably I need to put some strength exercises for lower back."" Maybe this will not help a lot. You need to ask yourself: ""Why lower back is tight?"" And here is the point. Psoas major is connected to lower back and thighs. And that is reason why you can not feel it with fingers. But you can feel it there symptoms. Symptoms are: active lower back and quads, unactive hamstrings and abdominals. So, if you want to see, if your psoas mayor are tight, you need to put fingers on those muscules to feel it.

Here is pelvic tilt in game, we call it anterior pelvic tilt. And I fix my exercises on my last week and it works. My fixes are:

- strech calves, quads, inner hips
- strength hamstrings, glutes and abdominals

This helps me to deactivate psoas mayor. But this is just half way, you need also to fix upper body. My fixes are:

- strech chest and upper abdominals
- strength middle back and front neck

Now we I stand feel that if hamstrings, obliques and abdominals are engaged, low back is released. This is prove that psoas major is released. And at the same time I also feel, that my traps are released.

So, be focus on this hidden muscule that you can not feel with fingers that is tight and you can only feel symptoms.",1

For backbends I put front leg on chair. This activate front leg more and make more strech in back leg.

Simply, chair will help you more power and help you go in strech more deaper. So can not be only for senior. You can try it.",1

"Yoga destroys my sleep qualityWhenever I do any serious yoga, the next night I wake up after 4h30 of sleep. I spend the rest of the night agitated, alternating between *very* light sleep and a dreamlike awakened state. Then I go on to have a sleep-deprived day.

After years of suffering from this affliction (and accumulating evidence that it actually is yoga that does this and nothing else), I've finally formed a theory as to what causes this. Some credit goes to _The World Beyond Your Head_, which provided me with the necessary vocabulary to articulate this.

When you're holding an asana, you're putting your whole focus into it, very consciously and intentionally relaxing under tension. It also means that you're training your body to take immobility as something to attend to.

So if today I do serious yoga, tonight after ~3 sleep cycles my subconscious gets bored of sleeping, and it becomes fixated on immobility as an object of attention. I'll spend the rest of the night with my consciousness resting, but everything else alert and engaged.

Put like this, it's not a coincidence that the supplements and drugs that treat this condition also make it more difficult to attend to things the next day. I'm intentionally inhibiting my tendency to direct attention at things.

It also explains why I have this problem with yoga and absolutely no other kind of exercise.

"A tribute to Lesley FightmasterThis is probably old news for some, maybe all, but I just found out today that my favorite youtube yoga instructor passed away in 2020. 

I decided in 2019 that social media wasn't for me. I deleted everything. Reddit is my only source of ""social media,"" using it primarily for advice and tips on topics that either interest me or help me with my health conditions. 

I bring this up because I am very out of the loop on world events, news, and social updates. 

Late 2019 into early 2020, I took a yoga class with my best friend at a local college. I thought it might be something fun to do together, and being that I love physical fitness, it might be something else I could add to my daily workout regimen. 

Months passed after I finished my yoga class, and I found myself struggling to stay on top of daily yoga routines. I found some yoga videos on YouTube (adriene, bird, kassandra), but even then, I couldn't find the motivation to push play and just flow through the video. 

That's when scrolling through my YouTube home page, I found Lesley and instantly fell in love with her energy. She not only appreciated the physical aspect of yoga but the spiritual aspect of it as well. Not to say the others didn't appreciate it, but Lesley had a very special way of getting that appreciation through to me. 

My husband and I have been doing her videos twice a day for months now, and I've never felt better. But today, I decided to actually go to her page and scroll through her recent uploads to see what she has been up to and what new videos she has in store for me only for my heart to break. 

I know what you might be asking. ""How were you doing her videos for months and never once thought to visit her page?"" And the answer to that is, I don't really know. But what I do know is that her videos have had a huge impact on my body as well as my mind. I was a very selfish and angry person. I still have my bouts, but I can see and feel a change in myself, and it feels nice. Lesley always saw the good and beauty in everything, at least from what I saw from her videos. 

I've never met Lesley, and sadly, I never will, but even after she left this world, she was able to make a difference in my life. 

Thank you, Lesley Fightmaster.",1
"Overactive and underactice rather then weak and tightI see that 90% people use the term ""tight"" and ""weak"" in opposite way. They think something like this. ""If muscule is tight, I need to strech, if muscule is weak, I need to strength."" This is simply not true. Muscules that are tight are the same time weak. Muscules become tight, because they do not have enough strength. When muscule lose the strength, become tight to protect from more injury. And muscules not become tight only in athlets but also if oposite muscule put them in length position (quads versus hamstrings).

So the better using needs to be overactive versus underactive. Overactive muscules are strong and flexible, underactive muscules are weak and tight. When I strech chest, quads, lats or glutes, I never feel pain. But if I strech traps, neck, hamstrings or shoulders, I feel pain. So, here you can see, that weak  muscules are tight and strong muscules are flexible.

So, if you feel, that somwhere you are tight, start to strength and strech to opposite muscules.

So, overactive and underactive are the right term and not weak and tight.",1

I have a towel from target (I forget the brand) that is great! But seldom in stock. I have another from Gaiam that technically is microfiber, but felt slightly rougher so I thought I could manage. I use it but don’t love it, and additionally my hands slide around even before I start sweating.

"What's your Dharma?I was in a really interesting session as part of my yoga therapy certification. It's the philosophy module and there were some really inspiring people participating. I hadn't thought of it as my dharma but, previously my purpose, contribution etc and it got me thinking as a conversation starter... what's yours? Do you know? Maybe not? 

In our breakout rooms I shared that mine is advocacy. Whether a coping mechanism or not, I try to believe that my physical pain and disability was ""given"" to me so that I can use it as a tool to help others whether it's through teaching guided meditations, accessible asana, holding space for those that need it or, even using my voice to help those that don't have the current ability. 

I don't mean to ""self promote"" but, as part of this, I started a guided meditation channel. It will always be free. This is my gift to others as I was lucky enough to be gifted asana when (and still am unable) to afford to attend classes. Almost all of my official training has been scholarship based and I'm incredibly grateful. I'm certainly no expert and am a student for life but, if anyone is interested, the link is:

"11 week beginner progress update: chaturangaSedentary female in my 30s. I started doing vinyasa yoga for about half an hour each weekday since mid Dec 2022. I did this by playing and just following along with youtube videos in my living room.

I'm not going to lie. There were many days when I was just sore and didn't want to do it. Or days when I felt too lazy. Or I was on my period. But I still did it anyways. I was annoyed or not happy at the start of the video but by the end, I was always relaxed and felt the stress lifted away from me.

Last update at the 5.5 week mark, I was finally able to do side planks. I've now reached the point at 11 weeks where I can do the chaturangas. On days when I'm too sore or tired, I still do the chaturangas but on my knees.

I personally do not see any changes in my body figure. Like I'm not toned or skinnier. In fact, my weight has been maintained and did not change. But I definitely have more functional movement and strength.

I am someone who has always had joint hypermobility and my lack of strength resulted in joint instability. So, to me, the gains in strength has been the most valuable thing from yoga. I hope to reach a day where my knee will never randomly collapse while walking due to weakness and an old injury with enough strength gained.

I hope with this update, I can inspire others to keep on going! You might not see any differences just like me, but you are definitely getting stronger day by day. Let's do this!",1

"Why Yoga Should be a Part of Your Daily Routine - Benefits and Tips to Get StartedYoga is an ancient practice that has gained popularity in recent years as a way to improve physical, mental, and emotional health. Incorporating yoga into your daily routine can have numerous benefits, including reducing stress and anxiety, increasing flexibility and strength, improving posture, and promoting overall well-being.

One of the great things about yoga is that it is a versatile practice that can be adapted to fit your individual needs and preferences. There are many different styles of yoga, ranging from gentle, restorative practices to more vigorous, physically demanding ones. Whether you prefer a slow, meditative practice or a fast-paced, sweat-inducing workout, there is a type of yoga that is right for you.

If you're new to yoga, getting started can be a little intimidating. Here are a few tips to help you get started:

Start with a beginner's class - Most yoga studios offer beginner's classes that are designed to introduce you to the basic postures and breathing techniques. These classes are a great way to learn the fundamentals of yoga in a supportive, non-judgmental environment.

Invest in a good mat - A good yoga mat is essential for a comfortable and safe practice. Look for a mat that is thick enough to cushion your joints, but not so thick that it throws off your balance.

Set aside a dedicated space - Having a dedicated space for your yoga practice can help you get into the right mindset and minimize distractions. Even if you don't have a lot of space, try to carve out a corner of your home that is just for yoga.

Practice regularly - Like any other form of exercise, the benefits of yoga come from consistent practice. Aim to practice at least a few times a week, even if it's just for a few minutes at a time.

In summary, yoga can be a powerful tool for improving your physical, mental, and emotional health. By starting with a beginner's class, investing in a good mat, setting aside a dedicated space, and practicing regularly, you can begin to experience the many benefits of this ancient practice.",1

"Connecting the Mind with the BodyThis is a concept that seems to resonate with a lot of people. I've done a little thinking about this recently because, after all, is our mind ever really disconnected from our body? The answer is yes in the sense that our minds are not limited by time and space in the same way that our bodies are. Our minds are free to engage with past and future and in different spaces from the smallest atom to the vast reaches of space while our bodies and senses exist and operate only in the here and now. Many of us spend our days working on things that are distant from where we are physically located. So yes, by focusing our attention on our bodies and our senses in yoga, that brings our mind into the here and now. For some, that brings a feeling of relief or respite. The here and now is always available and it can be useful to us. 

There's another aspect to this. When we look at the relationship between our bodies, our senses, and our minds, we realize that communication runs in two directions. In yoga, for example, our minds direct our bodies to assume a particular form and we may focus our senses on a particular place. At the same time, our bodies and senses are always transmitting information back to our minds, but the mind is not always listening. Deep into a yoga pose, when the mind is no longer directing the body to act, but is listening intently to its feedback, that is when we feel most connected to our bodies. That ability to remain focused on the here and now and to correctly interpret the feedback from our bodies and senses is an important skill in many walks of life.

"Yoga and Spine FusionsHello everyone! I am very new here and to yoga!

"Using alternate names for asanasI recently completed my 200hr YTT and after that experience I have walked away with a huge appreciation for the tradition of yoga and how sacred sanskrit is. If I ever teach a class, I want to honor the history of yoga and not make it too white-washed. 

I was just invited to teach a class, but they asked that I do it ""bird themed"" by calling each pose after a bird. (More than pigeon, eagle, and crow, etc) Like doing tree pose and calling it flamingo.  

When I pushed back, they said that there is an established ""bird yoga"" for kids. That poses have accepted alternative names after birds. I could not find a credible source for this. When I looked into it any ""bird pose"" that I am unfamiliar with are very advanced poses and I wouldn't do those for this audience. For example, I just learned there are poses called Peacock, sparrow, and hummingbird.

If bird yoga for kids exists, what are your opinions on changing the names of asanas to make it more ""fun"" and ""kid-friendly""?  

Personally, I would be happy to relate poses back to birds, but I would feel uncomfortable flat out calling an asana a different name.

"Yoga studio recording?A local studio i went to for a while has a camera installed and often post clips of the class to instagram. Sometimes the instructors even record on their phones, including their own involvement in the practice and post that as well. They use any class for marketing if it looks good. This is in addition to like half the class recording their own mats. Then the student’s insta posts get shared by the studio, making it just the norm for everyone.

I checked their policy online and it does say “can record and post you with or without your name at any time” so I guess that have everyone’s “permission,” legally, at least. 

I left a review online expressing my concern and now they are calling me. Worried I ruffled feathers unnecessarily so I took it down. I’m thinking I should have just reached out to them directly but I just didn’t like the idea of being that confrontational.

"Forward folds and tightness in legsSo as the title says - Forward folds and tightness. I have been practicing pretty much daily for just under a year now - when I first started, DD sucked, but I find it much nicer now. However, one thing that has never changed are my struggles with forward folds.

Whenever I enter a forward fold, my legs cry out with either trembles and shakes, or a tightness feeling (often with the shakes). Rag doll is supposed to be lovely, yet I find it torturous on my legs. It's not painful - but it's not comfortable either. This can have a negative effect my practice sometimes and makes me wobbly in otherwise usually strong held poses for me, like tree. 

Most teachers advise to bend the knees, but I actually find this makes the tightness/shakes worse. 

It's not just the folds - I find poses like high lunge can be quite uncomfortable on my legs too - don't start me on the twist variations. I am fine in all the warriors though. 

What am I doing so vastly wrong here? I have had 1-1 practice before, and attended lots of classes, but I have not been corrected in the folds (except maybe in my first few) - so surely I am doing something right also. 

I would appreciate any advice! Thank you all <3",1
"How to connect with my body while sober like I can if I’m high,I’m new to the subreddit so I apologize this is not the place to ask but I supposed people who take yoga seriously might be able to shed some light on this for me:

I’m trying to figure out how I can connect with my body without having had to smoke weed first.

Typically, not-high, I’m walking around with an unbalanced gait from carrying tension in a host of weird places. I injured my foot when I was 4 and according to some PTs this is to blame for issues with posture throughout my body because the scar tissue in my foot kind of warped my fascia/soft tissue, the effects of which kind of traveled through the body. I can fix it by stretching, but for some reason I can really only do this while high.

I’m not a regular cannabis user but when I partake I always gain the ability to really feel  my body, which means I can sense exactly what needs stretching and what needs strengthening in order to restore mobility and posture. myself through my own sort of impromptu yoga session dispenses with the undesirable posture/tension and eliminates pain in problem areas like my knee, hip, back, and spine, which means I can move freely.

But then a couple hours later I’ve tightened back up and I’m right back where I started because I’m no longer high and can’t isolate and dispense with the maladaptive tension. I’m not about to smoke weed every time I want to stretch/reset, but it’s like my ability to feel my body doesn’t even exist if I haven’t smoked weed. 

Some of you must know what I’m talking about. How can I get that “open dialogue” with the state of my body without having to use cannabis?

"I am very thankful for everything going to yoga has given meI started going going to yoga and then the pandemic hit. I didn't do anything for 2+ years. Then a few months back I started going to the yoga classes at my gym. I'd go once every 2 weeks or so. 

Then I started going twice a week. I struggled hard. Downward dog absolutely destroyed me. I kept pushing myself though and 5+ times during a 1 hour class I'd take child's pose cus I just could not keep up. 

I'd have small 5 min conversations with the instructor or other's taking the class and over a month or so. Next thing I know we sometimes have 30+ minute conversation after class. Instructor is out for valentines day and a woman in class tells me about this studio she plans to go to that night.

I thought ""how lovely would it be to do yoga instead of be home alone on valentines day."" So I treated myself and paid for a class.

  It was my first time ever in a yoga studio. The instructor owns the studio and brought a lil heart shaped chocolate box for everyone who came (there were like 6 of us)

  It was so nice, I honestly wanted to cry. The class was intense and I learned a lot.

I didn't go to yoga at the gym last week and another woman I talk with after class texted me. She said they (including the instructor) miss me and asked if I was okay. I didn't go because was coming out of a funk due to my PTSD being triggered. 

  That text honestly helped me snap out of it. 3 months ago, not even in my wildest dreams did I think I would be this genuinely happy and look forward to something so much.

   When I started, I couldn't even touch my toes, I low key despised downward dog (I couldn't plant my heels down, my legs burned every second) and I kept pushing myself. I can touch my toes without bending my legs now! I can sort of plant my heels down in downward dog.

"Recording During ClassI'm looking for some insights regarding recording during class.

Yesterday at a hot yoga class, a student set up in the front of a fairly full class at the front of the room. To be fair, she arrived after most other students had arrived, and there didn't appear to be too many spots left. As soon as class started, she set up her phone to record. I am sure she she was she was intending to record herself, but she had the camera turned around and I could see that from my position I was centered in the shot. I have seen other people record on occasion in the class (I can't recall if it was the same person), and it struck me as odd, but it didn't bother me too much because it I could tell they were recording either the instructor or themself.

Though these classes have helped me accept myself, I am pretty self conscious about my body. I am fairly new to yoga and don't feel like my poses are very graceful (and that's ok - I bring the best that I can offer to every class). Knowing that I was being recorded and not knowing how the footage would be used, I could not focus on my practice. I knew that I would either be unsettled allowing the recording to continue, or upset about causing a scene about the recording. About 5 minutes in, I whispered to the instructor to ask if I could switch spots with her, which would put me to the front of the room and out of the camera shot. But she didn't understand me so I told her that I didn't want to be recorded, at which time she went up to the student, put the phone down and said that someone didn't want to be recorded.

The instructor did not say anything further about the situation after class. My question for more experienced yogis is:

Should I say anything more about what happened to the instructor or just let it go?
Is this something that typically happens in other studios? I have been to a class years ago that was recorded, but the recording was done by the studio, and they notified everyone of the plan to record in advance. I really don't mind anyone recording their practice and can completely understand how beneficial it can be, but should others in the recording be aware?

Thank you in advance for any insights and feedback!",1
"Postpartum yoga - advise neededI used to practice yoga (beginner to intermediate poses) before my pregnancy. Now I am 2 months postpartum and need advise on yoga poses that focus on belly pelvic areas-

4) pigeon pose
5) shoulder stand ( not quite there yet!
6) Goddess pose

"Yoga classes in my area are either hot yoga or beginner-level... advice or online recommendations?I really want to get back into a regular practice of yoga, something like where I'd be doing a class once a day or at least most of the week. But I've found that my area is very limited to beginner-level yoga (my gym is part of a hospital, so many older people that aren't as fit) or hot yoga (which I generally hate; my clothes get drenched and I have a hard time maintaining grip even on simple poses).

First, does anyone have recommended online classes that are worth it for you? Free or paid is ok.

Second, if I were to try to tough out the hot yoga, and advice on how to deal with it? I think I dislike ""wasting"" an hour on flows that are frustratingly slow/easy a bit more than sweating. But it's honestly been a few years since I took a hot yoga class.",1

"Quick DIY bag!i needed a bag that would fit my mat and the essentials, but didn't have money. thankfully i did have a couple of old aprons lying around to cannibalize for parts! i figured some of you would also probably enjoy this type of bag, so why not share?

i took two aprons, laid them out flat (one on top of the other), and folded them lengthwise so the front was facing outward and the strings were together. then i sewed the bottom edge and the side, leaving the arm contour open. i tied the strings into a little loop and added a carabiner for a touch of extra utility. finally, i cut the neck straps off and sewed them together to make the carry strap. i attached the strap at opposite corners of the bag and added extra reinforcement at the attachments. this formed a main pocket in the center with two outer pockets, so i opted to add a button closure for the center one.

my mat fits perfectly in this thing with enough room for extra leggings, a water bottle, a small blanket, and a few other essentials. i had to sew it by hand and it took me a couple of hours, but if you have a machine it won't take more than five minutes. i would also recommend sewing one long seam straight down the middle of the aprons to delineate the outer compartments a little better, and of course if you're using aprons that have pockets you'll get bonus organization. if anybody would like a picture for reference, let me know so i can add one.

"Disliked poses? Have you tried......not going so deep into the pose?

This is a [follow up](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/11drnv6/disliked_poses/). I though i would start a different threat since there were many, many people disliking poses and i couldnt find a single reply not questioning whats going on there

The first aim you should have doing yoga is to learn to listen to your body. You are not taking crazy pills. If you dislike a pose, your body is talking to you. Dont ignore it and overwrite it with your will

Once you start feeling things, you are doing the pose amazingly. Thats the guide. You cant tell from the outside what is good or bad yoga. Trying to reach the final pose using your will or props is pretty useless

Do less

Take an extra breath instead of going deeper

Hating it is a good sign that you have gone too far

Use the in and out of the air as a track to follow

Videos and pictures of you will look worse and you might be tempted to think you are not doing anything of value, but thats not why we are here, is it?

"Any Yin yoga enthusiasts here?I love this practice. I try to go weekly on Sundays. Great way to end my weekend. I’m teaching this class for the first time next week. I’ve read Bernie Clark’s book and am hoping to have the theme be kidney meridians and root chakras focused. There will be some people new to Yin and I don’t want to scare them off with any wild hard long held poses. Any suggestions?

EDIT: because I got some negative feedback about how vague this question was I will rephrase this. 

I am a new teacher, I love the yin practice and practice this weekly at my studio. I have the opportunity to lead the class for the first time in a few weeks. I’m focusing on kidney meridians since that day is “national kidney disease awareness day” this is my theme, I will be targeting poses that are for the kidney and urinary bladder, I know what they will be already. (Hamstring and back stretches) I will be doing some breathing exercises at the start of class and explaining the focus of the class as well as what the goal of YIN practice is. I will end with savasana and a brief meditation. I will have many new people to YIN in this class. I would like to make it welcoming space and not “scare them off” because yin is not relaxing, it can be painful as we all know. I’m looking for people that have been teaching YIN before what can I do to make new students enjoy the “pain” of this class.

"Studio schedules classes too tight togetherSo I’ve been attending a tru fusion studio in my area ..mostly out of convenience. It’s in my neighborhood and they offer hot yoga classes. Although I find it a bit pretentious and corporate like in vibe - it’s been making sense with all factors included. Lately however , I’m finding myself leaving class frustrated mainly because they schedule classes back to back , essentially leaving no time for a proper shavasana in between. One minute after a teacher exits the room- you have the cleaners coming in letting in cold air , and sweeping a mop around your mat. I’ve mentioned it to one teacher , but apparently it’s still falling on deaf ears. Is tru fusion really just the money hungry / high turnover beast I gather them to be ? Haha.

"Need advice for squaring hips in pigeonThe title. It’s hard for me to gain awareness when my legs are alternated like this. 

Also question: I have a tendency to place my knee behind my wrist in upright pigeon. Should I try spreading my knee out farther, so that it’s more of the center of my shin behind my wrist, and my knee is outside of my mat? Or is my knee okay in my usual position?

Down dog also instructs to fold over in pigeon after setting it up in upright pigeon, but I can’t fold over all the way and I’m afraid of hurting myself because my hips aren’t square. I have pushed too hard in the past and experienced pain similar to sciatic nerve pain, so I’m worried I’m putting stress in the wrong areas. I can never seem to get a satisfying stretch in this pose. Sometimes I feel it outside of my hip, sometimes below the buttock of my folded leg, sometimes I feel a pulling in my groin (but it feels like more of a burn than a stretch).

"Disappointed in “Glo” yoga app and looking for new recommendationsSo I’ve been a Glo member for three years now. Their teachers brought my yoga practice to a completely next level.

"Is it normal to need rest days? Or am I overdoing it?Hi everyone!

Recently I've been doing two yoga sessions a day: usually a 5-15 minute one in the morning and a 10-30 minute one in the evening. I'm a total beginner, so I mostly follow YouTube videos targeted to beginners, but even then some of the poses are hard for me. Regardless, I try to push myself as much as possible, I do all of the poses/stretches as deep as I can, however if it gets painful I'll modify a pose or don't hold it as long. I really love the way my whole body feels right after a session, but sometimes I wake up in the morning and I almost feel like I did an intense workout the night before. Whenever that happens I try to go for some very gentle yoga but even that can be really hard in those situations so sometimes I feel like I need a rest day. Does that mean I am overdoing it?

"Recovering from Achilles injury and wanted to incorporate Yoga for recovery and life style. What do you think of my plans ?Hi Yogis,

I went over the FAQ page and getting started section for beginners and was able to figure out what I am looking for. I just wanted to get your input/comments if what I have planned out sounds reasonable or any guidance would be appreciated.

I recently started jogging after 11 months of recovery process from 2 full Achilles ruptures on my left leg which required 2 surgeries. I am now able to jog and do jump rope and soon to run a mile. Beyond that the recovery process made me mentally strong. I am 33 M.

In the past 2 months I have been practicing Vinyasa yoga in a class setting and got enough endurance to do 45-60 mins classes 3 times/week. Going forward I also wanted to focus on relaxing/stretching my body parts as I have very stiff body (even prior to injury). Beyond that I wanted to make Yoga my life style (3-4/week) esp for spiritual growth.

My question is in order to include different Yoga practices; for e.g Yin for opening up my body, Vinyasa for endurance/strength, and Kundalini for opening up Chakras and bring spiritual growth, **is it advisable to combine multiple yoga practices in different days of the week or is it better to to focus on one type of Yoga at the beginning and add more after few months ?  Or is it something I have to figure it out myself ?**

I am also including body building and core ex in my routine soon so it might be tough for me to do more than 4 days of Yoga per week.

Her approach to gentle yoga is a sun a series, planks, chair and ""pulsing"" chair, chaturangas and a lot of down dog.  Savasana is like 2 or 3 minutes.   I'd say about half or maybe a little more of the class is on the floor but the parts that aren't feel too intense for a gentle class.  It's doable for me, but i skip all the chaturangas and excess movement and it's just not what I want on a Sunday morning and not what I have come to expect from a gentle class.

"Learning about the anti-yoga communityI’ve discovered that there are entire populations of religious fundamentalists who have a bone to pick with practicing yoga. I’m having trouble putting this into context. The claim is that yoga is a sin, and invites evil spirits into your soul to live there and destroy your life. Things like meditation and breathwork are considered counters to prayer, and so by doing these things, God is replaced with Satan inside of you.

"Knees over toesI am a personal trainer/weightlifting coach certified in strength and conditioning and GP exercise referral as well as a yoga teacher. This is intended as a discussion thread and by no means to argue. I can speak from an ashtanga and Olympic weightlifting perspective and am hoping to use this tread to broaden my perspective.

Here’s mine. And I’ll use the example of virabhadrasana and utkatasana in my reasonings.

Knees over toes is absolutely fine in the absence of contraindications and the intention of the postures have been met.

So in ashtanga, the conditions of virabhadrasana are; 
- equal weight in all corners of both feet, - - back leg straight, 
- front femur parallel to ground. 
- Shoulders square to the front, 
- belly drawn in. 
- Hands pressed overhead
- dristi thumbs 
Now if all of those conditions have been met (which they rarely are) the knee wouldn’t have to go past the toe, you’d have to overcompensate in other areas, like softening the back leg to do it. But it’s not necessary.

Howvever, utkatasana, obviously many people would have to counterbalance their hips going back by sending the knees forward. Also I know foot/ankle mobility plays a major role and would need an entire separate post to talk about.

Now, that’s all assuming the practitioner isn’t contraindicated in any way. But, if you use osteoarthritis as an example, It makes sense to me that, if you cannot bend knee to be that strong in that degree of flexion, fine, don’t bend it. But with osteoarthritis it’s recommended to play with that pain threshold lightly so it rises, this is a method to reduce pain in ADL. 

So, are the people who shouldn’t bend their knees over their toes enough majority to put a blanket rule in led classes for everyone not to do so?
Ankle mobility comes before knee mobility, but both are very important.

Conclusion.
The knees are more resilient than you think, but remember the intention of the posture and these arbitrary rules should be taken on a case by case basis, and don’t even get me started with foot on knee with tree. 

Would love to hear your thoughts",1

"paying for yoga training?I have the opportunity to attend the teacher training at my studio starting in April. I adore my studio, their commitment to the history of the practice, the people, literally the best studio I can imagine. I have heard their training g is phenomenal.


I had a liver transplant back in June and yoga has truly saved my life. I began doing yoga on YouTube before I could even sit up by myself, just moving my legs. I  began learning as much as I could about mind body connection and meditating, absorbing all I could about yoga. I also quit drinking in April so the mental and physical aspects of recovery of recovery were massive and without yoga, I'm not sure how I would be right now. I want to pass that on. I truly believe this all happened for a reason and if it didn't, I'm going to make it be for one by helping others not go through it alone. 

I'm not working right now so I have the time, in fact if I can pull it together I would complete training almost exactly one year to the day of my transplant. Timing wise it's absolutely perfect, but I'm struggling with the 3k price tag.

My studio is working with me by offering a payment plan, but it's still a chunk of change, so to speak.

TL/DR are there loans or something that offer assistance with teacher training?.",1
"Why is downward dog, pretty much, a resting position in yoga classes?I find downward dog to be quite difficult. Why is this the default pose between other poses? It almost seems like yoga instructors use this as a rest between poses…

"I think hot yoga is helping me emotionally regulate. I have severe suicidal ptsd and having control of my cns is VERY HARDI just wanted to tell someone…. I was living actively suicidal daily for years then about weekly recently. The episodes are 4-6 hours of the most pain you could fathom. 

I went through a breakup with a toxic alcoholic in Nov and I was crying and emotionally eating at night and I’m isolated as F. I started going to yoga at night to see people in a room (remember I was suicidal), to not think about my ex, to not cry, etc etc 

I am a serious lifter and mountain biker I know how to move energy through my body and hit flow state. 

But I’ve been going to hot yoga a lotttt bc I don’t want to be sad and shit. 

Well I started to notice this week….I haven’t been suicidal in awhile and I look forward to going and just seeing the same faces. 

I have been in therapy for a decade, meds, and ketamine treatments. 

I only noticed a switch inside recently from the 3-4x hot yoga per week. I didn’t even know what anyone meant by breathe through things bc it was not easy for me to find any space from my pain. 

I knew my alcoholic ex dumping me! Was going to give me my life back, but I didn’t know how it would start……",1

I got sick for 2 weeks with laryngitis and a cold, making me unable to do yoga during that time. Due to constant coughing too, I pulled some of my ribs and/or diaphragm also, which has made it hard for me to do yoga again because of residual soreness. I’m finding now that I’m getting a ton of muscle soreness in general due to not working out, but when I try to do the yoga I usually do, my ribs/diaphragm get sore, and I’m not sure if I should push through it. When I went to PT this week, I was told to exercise lightly and to stop if I felt pain there. My back has been very tight, and my PT thinks this maybe contributing to the pain too . I feel like stopping yoga together has increased pain in other parts of my body now due to almost 3 weeks of lack of movement though.

Just looking for a brutally honest opinion here.

There is a class offering for Pilates (mat) during the week that would work well for my time slot. I've been doing lots of flow and hatha as well as the occasional yin/restorative class and feel confident in surviving the workout.

The concern: I'm a 35 year old, 200lb male. What's stopped me so far from going is that I have this preconception that the class will be full of women, and that any non-reformative Pilates is structured as such? I'm not worried about practicing with them at all, I'm just concerned that my presence might kill their ability to focus inward and keep to their mats throughout practice. I don't want to try something if it is going to detract from someone's practice, as I know how important the benefits of mine are to me.

Am I out to lunch in my assumptions about class composition? And maybe more to the point, would my presence be off-putting to your personal expectations of a Pilates mat class?

After a few months of PT I was back to my normal, however I want to increase my core strength and using yoga as a tool to do so however my flexiblity is pretty bad. In most positions I do them to my best ability so that I feel the stretch or my muscles tighten and feel the full effect or affect 😁.  Anyways, when I try and do the waterfall pose I don't have the best flexibility so my legs are at the 90 degrees while my back stays flat. I wind up doing some variation and it turns into a hard core, core workout. While I am not against that I am not sure if that's the intent or if there is a way to gradually stretch to do the position as intended? Appreciate the help on this one.",1

I’m male, 34yo. I have always been in relatively decent shape but I have always had a goal of becoming 190lb lean. In order to achieve this I have to put a few pounds of muscle and lose a few lbs of fat. I have been weight training since January but I’m really struggling with correct form certain compound movements due to poor flexibility. I keep getting discomfort in my lower back and it’s hindering my progress. I have been told that yoga will help me strengthen my stabilising muscles as well as improve flexibility.

I was wondering if there is a style out their that is suited to my ability and my needs. Unfortunately I don’t have time for classes. I work full time and then I look after my 1yo son on an evening. I have to get up at 04:30 to weight train and my next available time is 20:00 after I put my son to bed. This should give me a 30/45 min window to maybe fit some yoga in. Will this be enough time?

I have tried to watch some videos on YouTube and I do find them useful listening to an instructor talking you through the poses. I don’t mind paying to do some sort of video program if I need to pay.

"Mahabharata evidencesProofs of Mahabharata 
Introduction: The Mahabharata is an ancient Indian epic where the main story revolves around two branches of a family - the Pandavas and Kauravas - who, in the Kurukshetra War, battle for the throne of Hastinapura. 

Evidence 1 : The claim follows the findings at the excavation site of Sanauli, 68 km away from Delhi, last year, including the discovery of a ""war chariot"" allegedly driven by a horse, a rusted bow and arrow, a burial site and ochre coloured pottery, war shields, whip, torch and an antennae sword with hilt. ""The whip we have discovered is specifically the one that is used on a horse, not a bull. The wheels, pole and yoke are solid, with copper triangles. The helmets, shields are sophisticated. The Sanauli findings are a missing link with the Rigvedic culture and a sign of our civilisational continuity. Chariots figure prominently in Riveda, Ramavana and Mahabharata,"" he said.

Evidence 2 : In archaeological excavations around hastinapur, about 135 iron objects which included arrow and spearheads, shafts, tongs, hooks, axes, and knives were found, which indicate the existence of a vigorous iron industry.There are indications of brick – lined roads and drainage systems, and an agro – livestock based economy. The painted grey ware (PGW) of Hastinapura has been assigned to 2800 BCE and beyond.

Evidence 3 : This study was undertaken to quantify the radioactivity in soil and associated radiation exposure to the inhabitants residing in Sonipat district, Haryana, India. A total of 120 soil samples were collected from 30 villages. These soil samples were quantified for radioactive materials activity using HPGe detector. Activity concentration of 40K, 232Th and 226Ra in the soil samples of study area ranged from 463.8–696.9 Bq kg−1, 31.4–37.9 Bq kg−1and 41.5–54.9 Bq kg−1, respectively. Radium equivalent (Raeq) values of all samples are lesser than maximum permissible limit (370 Bq kg”1) acceptable for safer use of soil as building material.

Evidence 4 : led by an underwater archaeologist, several ancient artifacts were discovered, as well as the submerged remnants of the ancient Dwarka.
Between 1983 and 1990 the archaeologists discovered a fortified foundation on which the ancient city walls must have been built along the river banks. Stone blocks used for the construction, pillars, and irrigation systems were found but a debate is still ongoing regarding the dating of the vestiges, either from 3 000 to 1 500 years BC or from the Middle Ages. 

LITERATURE PROOFS:- 

Proof 1 : It is mentioned in Aadiparva, Adhyaya 62 that the records of the Bharat-Dynasty are recorded in the Mahabharata.

Proof 2 : It has been written in the epic from time to time that Mahabharata is an “Itihasa,” which exclusively means “thus occurred.”

Proof 3 : Lineage of Shri Krishna: The Greek historian Megasthenes has stated that Chandragupta Maurya was the 138 King in the lineage of Shri Krishna. This means that Shri Krishna did exist in the bygone era and that Mahabharat did really occur.

Proof 4 : Read the description of Kaliyuga as mentioned in Mahabharata. Whatever Krishna said tallies with creepy, mysterious accurateness with modern life as it exists today. And remember - this was written thousands of years ago! Fiction? Unlikely because there are way too many corroborations and tallying circumstances for it to be fiction.",1

"Not sure how I feel about it... (Astanga)Hi guys,

New to the sub, but this might be the right place to pose this ""feeling"" rather than question.

I am well into the nondual path (if you can call it that) but have acknowledged I need more connection with my body.  I am very hesitant to engage in most practices for they go deeper than we can (specially westerners) usually perceive. You are subscribing to a lineage to something waay bigger and above you, it's something I am familiar with and 'can see' if that makes sense to anyone here.   


Yoga is so diluted these days, most YTT fused with some form of westernized pilates class, we go for the fitness aspect more than the ""yolking"" (though I do love me some yoga pant butts so please don't stop that) . It just feels... inauthentic? 

Anyway, I started doing Ashtanga recently as it's closer to its root imo and I do love many aspects of it. Out of the yogas (physical yoga that is) it feels the most legit one. The mysore style feels right as it should be, and the teacher's great, it's all there. It's just this feeling that I'm subscribing to something I can't quite put my finger on... Something foreign of course, but once things cross these ""higher realms"" and borders, I like to be decerning with that kind of stuff and to surrender to this is not easy, or don't know if I want to. I don't know if this is the best place to share that given that I assume most on here are already subscribed, and nothing wrong with that, I know it's a direct path for many. I just don't know if it's for me ""my path"" per se. I love its benefits but I know it's so much more than that. Can someone acknowledge or recognize this, I haven't found much besides angry christians against yoga. I practice others forms of yoga more casually (jnana and new to raja) in my everyday life, I just don't know why this hesitation. Is it mind or something deeper that recognizes. Also what's up with Patanjali and Pattabhi Jois?

"Establishing home practice, Sirsasana and Sarvangasana, morning practiceHi all, 

I've decided to try going it alone to establish a really solid home practice. I've been going to a studio very dedicatedly for about 3 years now, and I have progressed to a moderately advanced level of practice in terms of asana difficulty. 

I have always struggled with consistency and dedication in home practice. Often I leave my morning practice (at home) a little bit frazzled, weak, and agitated. 

I have been reviewing Iyengar yoga literature for help with this (this is what I have been taught in) and there is frequent reference to the fact that Sarvangasana and Sirsasana (and Paschimottanasana, for that matter) are better practiced in the evening for their rejuvenating effect, and that if practiced in the morning, this may be agitating. The recommendation is that a focus on standing poses and backbend practices are better in the morning. I have a regular practice of headstand and shoulderstand and there is a big emphasis on daily practice of these poses in Iyengar yoga. (I personally am on board with this, although I accept that there are other attitudes to these poses.)

I would like to feel energised by my morning practice, not depleted and stressed. I feel like this advice that I found may be helpful, but I would like to hear more experienced people's perspective and advice.

I think I also struggle with conflicting feelings in my home practice, on the one hand, feeling like it is not intense enough for progress, but on the other hand, losing focus and getting tired and fed up during the practice.

I wonder if I should be doing two shorter practices (say 40 mins each) one in the morning and one in the evening to accomodate focusing on different aspects of practice.",1
"Hello everyone, I just started getting into Yoga for back pain and have a question. Sorry in advance if this question goes against the rules.Here is a comment I made on a popular youtube video for back pain.  
 Hey Adriene. First I just wanted to say that I love your personality, your jokes, and your positive energy; and, thank you for making this video. Unfortunately I hurt my back terribly about a month ago. Doc said it is only a muscle strain but it should have been healed by now. He took x-rays just to make sure.

So I thought I'd give this a try. The first thing I noticed is that it hurt pretty bad but honestly there was another side of it that was VERY relieving. Yesterday when I was doing it i was thinking ""wow, this feels so GOOOOOD!"" I thought for sure I was going to feel much better because of it this morning but to my suprise my back actually hurts a lot worse. I am thinking about doing the video some more today but I don't want to make it worse. My question is this: is it possible that the pain I am experiencing from this yoga is normal at first?

"yoga retreat experienceHi everyone! I am currently on my first yoga retreat, have been practicing yoga and Meditation for about 10 years (kinda on and off). The retreat where i am at is well planned, has a concept behind it, location absolutely stunning and food delicious. BUT it is absolutely not what I expected. There is so much sharing about our experiences, standing in circles, Holding hands, sharing what we are grateful for today, connecting with the others... for me yoga and Meditation is going inwards, beeing with myself. Of course from time to time I share my experiences with well chosen people. But this feels kinda odd and I have to admit I have not been feeling my best the last days. After some time I could see it as an oppurtunity to learn saying no and stepping back from things I feel uncomfortable with, but that was not what i came for. I am wondering if these activities are typical for a yoga retreat? What are your experiences? Feel free to share your stories :)",1
"Instruction to 'suck in your stomach, see your ribs in the mirror' in BikramI did my third Bikram class today, and I am getting more and more irritated by the instruction. The script is incredibly cringe, especially when they use his phrases that seem pointless, e.g: ""pulling is the object of stretching"".

Clearly it isn't for me, so I won't go back. I'm happy I tried.

But something that pisses me off so much in class is the instruction to **'see your ribs in the mirror'.** I happen to be able to see my ribs in the mirror when I suck in my stomach (I have a massive rib cage), so I'm not just upset that I can't do it. I'm upset because of how toxic it is. Most people can never do that, and for a lot of people it would be unhealthy if they could. 

There was a clearly anorexic girl in the class. The last thing she needs is for a teacher to encourage having visible ribs.

We're boiling hot, we are all in pain, and suddenly our attention is drawn into what we look like, and how our body is failing this instruction. My sense of being lost in the practise disappears.

I know I should get over it, and focus on the practise. But this seems like such a small insignificant change to make to 'the dialogue' that would accomodate more bodies. 

Why do we need to be purists about following a script made by a sexual predator? Can the same thing not be achieved with other words?

I want to mention this to my yoga studio. Do fellow yogis think it's worth saying anything? Does anyone have a different opinion they can share with me?",1

"Understanding pelvic tiltI finally learned, why I can not progress and increase range of motion in down part of the body. If you have rounded back in forwald fold or downward dog, your hip flexors are not activated and if they are not activated, you can not strech glutes and hamstrings. Hip flexors are working together with lower back. Hamstrings and glutes are working together with abdominals. Now when I start to use flat back in those 2 poses, I feel more strech in hamstrings and glutes. So, everything is in your pelvic tilt.

"Tips for confidence after long break and weight gain?Hello. I'm getting back into yoga after nearly a year off. I used to go 5-6x per week. I started working full time and have gained 30lbs in the meantime. I've got young kids and our time felt so limited as is that I felt guilty going. But I realized I need to make my health a priorty to be better for them too, so I'm going 1-2x per week. It's not much but better than nothing! My thing is....withe the weight gain, poses just aren't the same. My belly and thighs get in the way. I can no longer fully wrap my ankle around my calf in eagle pose. I feel my belly in lunges and it makes me feel uncomfortable.

"Finding your appropriate edge in Hot Yoga?So Friday night I went to a Drop In class at a new-to-me studio.

This is not the good level of muscle soreness I'm used to, I definitely overdid it.

"Guided Yoga Nidra?I’m looking for excellent quality guided Yoga Nidra.

Please consider this before suggesting any content and please excuse my bluntness. I am looking for something specific or at minimum high quality, so don’t just throw half as suggestions-

I once had a guided meditation CD that I got from a library. It was many years ago and I lost the name. The author was Sri… it was not  anyone very famous so please don’t suggest it might be one of the big names (he’s not). At the time I didn’t know it but it was a Yoga Nidra CD. Narrator was male and spoke English. Maybe American accent. He had a soothing voice but not annoying in the way so many narrators can be. He came off NATURAL, not forced like a gentle, creepy whisper (no offense if you like that stuff). He def did not sound like John Kabbat Zin. I can’t stand that guys voice! There was light background music but not the same old angelic keyboard “ahhhhhh🎶”. He guides you through breath, focusing on long inhales-hold-exhales-hold with diaphragmatic attention and cues like, “inhale prana, exhale negativity… imagine inhaling vibrant life force energy (prana) and exhaling negative energy…” then a body scan using visualization like “now inhale and draw prana in from your toes to your ankles…” then you do PMR on every muscle, and then a final scan in which you say to yourself, “I relax my X, I relax my X, my X is relaxed…”

Sound good? It was!

If you ever had that CD and recall the title and autor, please share!

If you know very similar guided meditations, please share.

I don’t care for whispering women or monotone British men. They appear to be popular but I don’t like that.

I like natural sounding narrators. I don’t want to imagine the narrator in their home office recording Yoga Nidra into a microphone over corny keyboard tracks of angels singing. It’s so tacky! I can see these narrators with their headphones and microphones recording tracks. 


The good features: breath work, visualizations, legitimate Yoga cues, body scans, PMR, and relaxation.

Please share.

Btw,I already have one of those meditation apps and I’m not impressed by the content.",1
"Does anyone else “lose progress”after a couple weeks off from practicing?I had to take 3 weeks off from my yoga practice due to a hiking trip (I was still very active during that time but not practicing yoga). On my return, I can barely reach my toes whereas before I left I was comfortable extending to have my entire fingers on the floor, not just the tips.

It's not painful but it still feels like it was pulled further than it was ready and does become painful if I move myself too far into the stretch, and I am aware of something in the area (not pain) when walking sometimes.  It still feels strong so I don't think I pulled it but it is a little bit worrying.

I feel like crushing my own b@ll$ can’t be part of the pose, but its the logical consequence of following the instructions I find. It does have the effect of straightening my spine, which seems like the goal here, but again the crushing makes the position unworkable.

"Am I fat or am I inflexible?Ok the title is a little misleading. I am fat, and I have started practicing yoga 2-3 days a week. A lot of poses (especially twist poses) are so frustrating for me because I feel like the sheer volume of my body fat gets in the way. My thick arms, stomach, and thighs prevent me from reaching around my body. I often feel like I'm straining against my own skin. Like even if I was certainly flexible enough, the pose would still be physically impossible because of all the flesh in the way. But I don't know that for sure. 

Are there any fat (or previously fat) folks here who can speak to this? If I keep working on my flexibility, will the fat not matter as much? How do I know if it's my flexibility to blame, or when I need to stop pushing because of my body's physical limitations? Are there some adjustments I can make to accommodate my body in its current state? Sometimes even just the lotus diamond sitting pose feels like I'm pushing my stomach against my thighs to comply. I often google ""yoga tips for fat people"" and never find anything helpful.",1

"Does knee pain in yoga go away? (beginner)I’m new new to yoga (just finished my first at home session 15 min ago) and while doing the table fold or just anything on my knees, it made my knees hurt. For context I am heavy (250) so for now I’m just chalking it up to my weight, but does everyone experience knee pain when they first begin? And is it something you get used to/fades as you continue? Or is it just me? 

(Reason why I also think it’s just my weight and not an actual injury is because when I try searching for knee pain in yoga, most people mention having an injury or feeling pain around the knee. For me it’s like the ball of the knee that is directly taking my weight. I did fix my posture so when I did table fold the weight was distributed between my knees and hands and that helped a lot but that knee pain was more prominent than my hands)

"Yoga/pilates suggestions for muscle recoveryHey!

Just after some advice, I have been having some issues with muscle recovery within working out at the gym and my physician has told me my muscles are just extremely tight and stressed, which I do not doubt.

I have been considering looking into doing like a follow on yoga/pilates video and wondered if anyone here has any suggestions or has been in a similar situation and found one that helped them?? Or just for general suggestions of creators on YouTube that make stuff regarding muscle recovery?

"Overheating while sleeping on savasanaI am on the path and I have decided to address my sleeping behaviour.

I have started sleeping on hard surface (thin hard mattress on the floor) in savasana position.

"Best stretches?Hello,

In weight-training we got some «base» lifts like bench, squat and deadlift (pullups, overhead-press).
Those lifts are generally a very good foundation and activate most muscles in a few exercises.

So, is there anything similar when it comes to stretching? 

I know it might not be conpletely «yoga», but I’ll try here anyway.

"Intense pain in butterflyHello! I've been practicing yoga for many years, but until the past year or so it has been very sporadic. Since getting into it with regularity, ive been noticing a very intense pain in my groin area when doing butterfly while laying down (sorry i dont know the proper name for it). 

I weightlifting 4-6 times per week, and am extremely cardiovascularly active as well, so yoga is a big part of how i keep my body well tuned and I rely on it for stiffness and mental health and wellbeing. It's really frustrating doing this pose, as its one of the best for me for loosening my hips, as well as it facilitating a lot of emotional release, and I just don't know if I should push through the pain or if something is wrong. 

I know no one here can tell me what's going on with my anatomy, but just looking if anyone has experienced this before. Any help or advice is appreciated :)",1

"DAE for the most part enjoy where yoga is at in our modern world?I see so much complaining about so many things in modern yoga, and a big part of that is it's not seen as ""traditional"".  To my knowledge, the original forms of yoga were solely pranayama and a smattering of other things, and the vast majority of the physical asana we flow through today is European and at most 150 years  old.  


And you know what?  I love it.  I love that I CAN connect postures to breathing, to work on flexibility (which is huge for not getting injured, I find as I grow older).  I love the physical postures.  But I also love the breathwork, both during and after.  I love spending ample time in shavasana to collect myself from either an intense or gentle practice.  I love that there are so many free resources for a recluse like myself to learn from, and that studios have mostly opened back up so that those that choose in person classes have a place to go.",1

"Have you met many toxic yoga teachers?I've been practicing yoga for 8 years and I'm taking a yoga course to become an instructor.

I realized I had this strange belief that all yoga teachers followed 100% all Yama and Niyama, were all cured of their traumas, etc. Watching too much Sadhguru, I guess ;) 

And now I see I was wrong: 

My yoga teacher is 60 yo and she became a teacher 20 years ago. I've recently been working more one on one with her and I've caught her making some passive-aggressive comments to me, criticizing my personality, saying I shouldn't be shy, that I've copied someone else in one instance, etc. etc. (some of these comments were made in front of other teachers and students, which I find even more surprising, as I felt she was trying to humiliate me).

Any thoughts on this?

I'm really surprised, but at the same time, it was eye-opening.

P.s.: I had met at least 2 yoga teachers before that seemed a bit mean, but I just thought they were the exception. I didn't know this teacher I chose to take the course with also had this ""strange"" side...",1

"My Journey with YogaHello, I’m 69, and have been practicing for 29 years.  Initially, I eschewed the “woo woo” stuff, and only worked with the asanas.  Then, over time, I noticed that the more i practiced, the more i wanted to practice,  And my understanding of my body, and my psyche began to deepen.  Eventually, learning to enjoy myself in this life:  With this body, with its strengths, its weaknesses, and its pains.  With this brain, monkey and egotistic, patient, kind, and so much more calm.  Open to the mystical mysteries I used to call “woo woo”.

"Is anyone else suddenly seeing porn videos/playlists show up in your YouTube search results when searching yoga?I would post screenshots but most of them are very NSFW. They tend to only come up when I'm searching for yoga videos.

I've been doing yoga for about two years now and usually will follow hour-long videos of instructors online. This past week or so, I've gotten ""suggested"" video playlists that are *very obviously* porn (like the thumbnail will be boobs or graphic sex, and I thought it might be clickbait so I clicked on it, and the whole video is porn) every time I search for yoga videos. The playlists have 20-30 videos and somehow have *millions* of views? Most of these videos have been up for months. I've never seen these kinds of playlists recommended to me in the past.

I also want to state I've never watched porn on YouTube and didn't even know there *was* porn on YouTube before this.

It was upsetting this morning because I was at home with my parents and wanted to do yoga with my mom. I was scrolling through my search results on my phone (connected to my TV) with my mom to figure out what video to do, when an obvious porn thumbnail (a close-up of... uh, intercourse) popped up and it was extremely awkward. I explained to her what's been happening but she probably thinks I watch porn on YouTube all the time now.",1

I am a competitive shooter, like travel the country several times a year, shoot 20,000 plus rounds a year kind of shooter.  Yoga helps me focus on the mindset of such a high level of competition, I am able to exist in the moment, to move through my mental stage plan while I'm shooting but also flow through any mistakes as they happen. Yet somehow, Yoga also helps me remove myself from the adrenaline and stress before I shoot.

"Reducing Upward Dog/Urdhvamukhasvanasana in Vinyasa FlowsRecently there was some comments about not feeling strong enough when doing vinyasa and lots of tips came through about it. I am strong and confident in the poses but I often don't feel warm in my lower back until well into a practice so liked the idea of taking some of the options more often and leaving my ego behind in exchange for a healthy spine. The options I've been trying include:

1. Maybe just skip it-surprisingly great advice
2. Stay in cobra/baby cobra
3. Use 8 point pose to gather strength and focus on breath
4. Stay on knees
5. Move into plank and back to downward dog 
6. Just drop to chatauranga and press back up etc.

After reading all the tips I decided to start implementing them into my practice. With these options I have left my upward dog out until we are close to the end of a practice and my back is feeling open and awesome. I often feel really strong at this point of practice so my last few vinyasas with upward dog are always my most confident and in my body/strong poses of the day. 

What it has done is delivered increased range in all my backbends, seemingly solidified my comfort just hanging out in chatauranga and plank, increased my core stability as I am really focussed on core in all the alternate poses rather than my shoulders or lower back as I find I am in upward dog.

I think it was a great reminder that modifications can give new perspectives and increase strength so thanks to everyone who commented on that other thread. Would love to see more discussion of modifications on here and maybe more about using props to advance practices.",1

"Moral struggleHello all! I want to preface this post by saying that my love for Yoga and the cultural which birthed it runs deep. In everything I do, I wish to be authentic, loving, and open to growth. When I began yoga it was asana that I was most concerned with and over the last eight years I have began to understand and practice Yoga in its fullness with respect to its roots.

Now with that being said, I am having a bit of a moral dilemma. When I was in college I got the Anahata symbol tattooed on my chest. I believe it was a misguided decision and if I could go back I would not have gotten it. However, now I have it and I have grown to love it and continuously practice a chakra practice that is not watered down by western occultism ( think Wheels of Life type books ). As I also continue to approach work in regard to cultural appropriation in my life and practice I can’t help but feel shame and embarrassment for my past decision. My intention is never harm but I know that intentions don’t always translate as they are meant to. 

So I suppose my question is: what do you think? How might I come to terms with this tattoo and the way Yoga has been commodified and bastardized? And is it possible for people not of south East Asian culture to have these tattoos without appropriating? 

I am open to learning and sharing, just please be kind. 

Thank you 🙏🏼",1
"A Love Letter to My Yoga Studio on Valentine’s Day…I’ll always be grateful for the things my yoga practice has brought to my life. The yoga philosophies and principles have shaped my perspective on myself and the world around me in such meaningful ways, and I experience so much more joy on a regular basis than I did before yoga! 

But today I’m feeling specifically grateful for my studio itself. I’ve met so many sweet people in class, I’ve watched some of them become teachers themselves, and have even made a couple of close friends. Every January the owner does ‘yoga Bingo’ where you can win a free month. You fill your bingo card by doing things like trying a new class, taking a walk in nature, or cooking a meal using all the colors of the rainbow. It’s cute, thoughtful, and encourages self care. The owner always does a morning class at least on holidays like Thanksgiving or Christmas Eve, for the people who don’t celebrate or are alone. Not necessary at all, but so kind. 

The teachers all work so hard to switch up the content of the classes and keep things fresh. They’re encouraging, but gentle and kind. All levels of experience are welcome and they always give extra help or guidance if you ask.

My studio has become one of my favorite places to be, I take four classes a week and I’m always disappointed if I have to miss one. 

What are you most grateful for, or what do you love most about your studio?

Happy ❤️ Day

"Vent: I’ll never understand why people leave a yoga class when the teacher starts guiding people through cool downI go to a yoga class that incorporates weights a few times a week. It’s always a very full class, pushing 40 people. And there’s usually 5-7 people that pack up and leave 10 minutes early because that’s when the teacher guides the cool down. I see others who stay there, but continue with cardio while everyone else is cooling down. I get that some people don’t care about preventing injury, but it’s so disruptive to the rest of the class who actually want to have a nice cool down/savasana experience.

The studio has two classrooms that each hold about 40 people. I’m not trying to shame folks who have to leave early for a variety of reasons, and I should have included this in the original post, but my frustration is not with people slipping out quietly at the end and set up by the door or let the instructor know, I’m frustrated by people who loudly pack up their mat, water bottles and weights and step loudly next to peoples faces to fight their way out of class early. I know some people say “take a different class,” but I also see one folks in the comments who say “I leave early because I can’t take a different class,” and I’m one of those folks who can’t take a different class, I can only make it to 730 or 8 pm classes.",1

"Shaving in the locker room shower??This was on a holiday where my hot yoga studio had a modified schedule. It was a big holiday and it takes a lot of logistics for people to make it to yoga on a holiday morning at all.

I go into the locker room to shower. There are two showers and one is under construction. That leaves one shower for about 8 women and the woman who is next declares to everyone in the locker room, “I’m going to be a while. I’m going to my boyfriend’s house right after this and need to shave my legs.” 

A bunch of us look at her, look at each other, stand there in shock that this woman, who a moment before was talking about having been a yogi for 13 years, is going to shave her freaking legs in the only working shower on a holiday class. (Plus chances are she’s shaving her vag also if she’s going to her bf’s.)

I didn’t say anything because I was new to the studio and didn’t want to make waves. I got dressed and went home completely sweaty and showered there. I still see this woman at yoga almost everyday and sometimes come up with ideas on what I could say.

"Overhead stretch modificationGood morning! 

I was wondering if there was a good modification to a pose where you stretch your arms over your head (like in Mountain pose with your arms over your head reaching towards the sky). 

We moved, and where I am doing Yoga now has low ceilings, so I only have a few inches above my head.

Thanks!",1
"Questions on KundaliniI tried out Kundalini Yoga recently and I'm full of questions. I find plenty of different answers to these online, so even though most of these questions are ""searcheable"",  I find it hard to trust information online these days.

So here are a couple of questions. Feel free to answer just a single one. Thanks in advance for your help.

1. What is the difference between asana and kriya?
2. How were the kriyas discovered? Did someone just go ""I bet if I make cactus arms and rotate left and right while inhaling and exhaling, that'll help out release my kundalini energy"". How does one come across these things?
3. What exactly is Kundalini energy?
4. On mudras: I read that these are just symbolic. I also read that different mudras help energy flow differently through one's body. Can't make sense of these two bits of information together. What are mudras and how were they discovered?
5. The teacher said inhalation and exhalation should happen through the nose. Why is that? And don't you guys have issues with snot all over if you inhale and exhale through the nose for 1 hour? Even if I blow my nose before the class, that's bound to happen in the winter times for me \^\^

Big thanks to whoever answers any of these.",1

"Finding sukhaI've heard sukha translated as effortlessness and ease in asana. I really struggle with finding this, especially in challenging poses where my muscles might be shaking to hold myself up. How do you find sukha in your practice?",1
"Is shaking while holding a pose normal/healthy?We talk a lot about finding your compassionate edge, where you’re pushing yourself but not in pain.

No pain, just shaking.",1

I can re-centre/focus after an interruption fairly well, but frequent and loud phone alerts are particularly hard to bounce back from for me. I will continue to do the work on my practice, but a lot of this seems thoughtless.

Over my last dozen or so practices I have heard phones in 9 or 10. I know we can't always completely disconnect from the world. Those who work on call etc. have to be available but vibration and visual alerts can be great for this. The rest of us don't need to hear your phone beep every five minutes.",1

"Perfection is aggressionA fellow yoga teacher said these words and it really pinpointed a feeling I get sometimes in yoga (especially Ashtanga) surroundings.

"Some yoga thoughts I finally put pen to paper for.Yoga in it's most wholesome form is not just exercise, it's lifestyle.  This is not unique, as can be seen if one takes even a shallow dive into many movement traditions.  Kung Fu schools emphasize the lifestyle of their movements, how their training is not simply martial arts, but a code of discipline for living one's life.  However I am drawn to Yoga, because I am a recovering YouTube addict and it is what was easily put in front of me while I would scroll through the app.  

Regardless, in moving, in practicing the asanas, I have realized that it has become a practice of ease of living.  Last year I was caretaker to my pregnant wife, as well as a beginner practitioner.  My practice required mental and physical strength development, foundational asanas, to make my neglected 29 year old body a proper support for my pregnant partner.  I needed to be able to do more around the house, I needed to be able to help her out of bed and get her things around the house quickly.  When my practice & meditation assisted in these things it was when it felt most productive and powerful.

This year I am caretaker to my new daughter and my postpartum wife, as well as a more practiced yogi.  This has required me to hone what will allow me to bend, lift my daughter, dance with her to rock her to sleep, bathe her, do even more household chores while mom feeds her, and train up to be a proper early playmate for my girl.  On top of all this, I have less time in my life to myself, so I must be prompt and focused in my training or else I will lose what few chances I have for it.  Meditation has taken a larger role in my practice, as it has allowed me to train this focus even when my mat and yoga space are unavailable.

I've realized my true strength doesn't come from training alone, it can't.  It comes from a unity between mind and body set on a common purpose, at the center of it all.",1
"Yoga and Dairy - Thoughts?Hello everyone. Namaste 🙏

Hindus consider the cow sacred, and therefore many won't eat beef. One of the reasons they consider them sacred is because they make milk, which can be drunk used in cuisine and used in religious rituals etc. Cows are also sacred because they are mainly used to work the fields, especially in ancient times. Because of all the benefits of cows, many Hindus refrain from eating beef, because our scriptures say it is a sin to kill a cow.

However, part of the dairy industry involves cows being killed when they can't produce milk anymore and calves are killed for beef. Therefore, if a Hindu lives in a country where this happens in the dairy industry, it is unethical for them to consume and use dairy products.

I understand there are some farms that don't kill cows in the dairy industry, but this milk is to expensive for me to buy.

I because I want to continue practicing my religion and ahimsa using milk from cows but I don't want to be implicit in violence. What to do? Can anyone who is a vegetarian yogi advise me?",1

I don’t understand. Every studio I emailed said they will not be offering those classes and try to persuade me to try something different. I’ve taken other classes, and I will time to time to switch it up a bit, but I really don’t like them as much.

Within the past few months I’ve branched out into some other forms of exercise, mainly weightlifting, and I’ve felt myself struggling to get excited about yoga. I’m feeling low on motivation, bored of my usual practice and classes, yet too anxious to join a new/more challenging studio. 

I don’t know what to do. This is the first time since I began practicing yoga that I’ve ever gone weeks without practicing.

"What other forms of exercise will help me get better at yoga?A kind of lengthy background but I think it’s important lol: 
I’m currently doing hot yoga 3 times a week, 2 of the classes are at one studio and one class is at another studio.

The two I take at Studio A are really fast paced, honestly really gets my heart pumping, the room is usually well over 100 degrees and I leave drenched in sweat. The other one at Studio B is about 90 degrees, feels a lot more like strength training, a little slower and holding the poses for much longer. I love both sets of classes for different reasons 💛 all of that background to ask, if I want to get better at yoga but can only do it 3 days a week, what other forms of exercise can I do throughout the week to help? I try to run a couple days a week or at least walk. I stretch every night before bed and do some planks and pushes every other day. TIA!",1

I've always been addicted to food, specifically junk food. I would use it to control my emotions and make myself feel better. I tried diet after diet and nothing worked. I would eat better for one week, then give in for one piece of cake, and just fall back into old habits. 

Now, I WANT to eat good stuff. I haven't touched refined sugar for 3 weeks and I don't even WANT to. I'm making efforts to also start eating whole wheat stuff and not white flour stuff. I don't buy processed things at the grocery store. 

I've been in a relationship for 2 years and been so unhappy, because I'm a people pleaser and I would always put my partner's needs first and completely erase my needs. 

Two days ago, I decided no more. I'll say what I think and I'll mean what I say. I'll affirm myself and my needs. I'll go do the activities I want by myself. I'll pick up new hobbies on my own. Yes, I'm in a relationship, but I'm also an individual. 

I'm also making other more personal changes to my life. Changes I've always wanted. 

None of this would've happened without yoga. Yoga gave me the self-awareness I needed. I feel like I've been living in a dream where things just happen to me. And yoga woke me up. Now I do things. I'm the one controlling my life. My life isn't controlling me.

"HypermobilityIs deeper not better? Is proper alignment more important than “feeling a stretch”?

I’m looking for some insight regarding hypermobility and home practice. I’ve been regularly practicing at home for almost 2 years now, before that in studio for a year. I’m mildly hyper mobile and I’ve known that since I was a child (elbows and knees hyperextend). I’m very careful to always micro bend my arms and legs during practice. Some poses come easier to me than they probably should (full lotus for example). 

Recently I’ve been thinking I may have more hyper mobile joints than just my elbows and knees. Sometimes in down dog I press my chest back towards my legs to feel a stretch in my shoulders. My arms through torso area ends up sorta bananaed in this shape. I recently saw an instagram post saying that was bad alignment and it got me thinking..

Am I setting myself up for injury because I often search for the stretch? I’m big on listening to my body and I never push myself to any discomfort or strain.

"Long story... but basically, the yoga studio doesn't want my autistic sister to take classes aloneI got into yoga a few months ago by taking some classes at my gym. However I decided to go to a dedicated yoga studio as the gym is more exercise focused. The people at the yoga studio are more slower paced and knowledgable, but I feel like there's a culture where we aren't supposed to ask questions. Everyone is supposed to focus on themselves, there's more of a ""spiritual"" atmosphere. I didn't mind this, it was my favorite studio out of the ones I tried and had some great classes, but now I'm getting into conflicts. 

So, my parents do yoga also and my autistic sister often takes classes with me. She is normally quiet but sometimes (rarely) will speak at the wrong time or not know what's going on. She is very athletic, much more than I am, and she enjoys yoga more than I do. 

A few weeks ago I was in a class with my Mom and sister. This is a long story but I'll try to make it as short as possible. It was a very crowded class and my sister was having trouble figuring out where to put her mat. She asked me and my Mom for help so we walked over to try to help her. The instructor told us in a rude tone to stop talking and return to our mats. Didn't try to help my sister at all. After the class, she confronted my Mom and scolded her for being late (we weren't actually late). The discussion kept escalating, ending with the instructor screaming at my mother, calling her a ""bitch"" and saying none of us were allowed back (she did not speak to me or my sister at all).

I spoke to the head of the yoga studio about this incident. The whole class was being recorded and I felt like the owner took our concerns seriously, saying the tone she heard in the recording was unacceptable. She told us that in the future we should arrive 15 minutes early which I agree to. She also said my sister should not take classes by herself, someone in the family should always be waiting outside the door. I agreed to this at first because I did not want any more conflict, but I don't really see the point. I was never given any reasoning for this decision. All of the instructors we spoke to have assured us my sister does fine on her own and doesn't need babysitting. So we just didn't do it. No other studio or athletic class has expressed discomfort with her being alone. She's in her mid 30s and often walks to the gym by herself, and would go to the yoga studio by herself if she could drive.

Recently the instructor emailed me ""reminding"" me that someone must be outside the door every time my sister is in a class. I told her I am not sure this is necessary and asked if I can speak to her about this issue. No response so far. 

I really genuinely like this yoga studio and so does my sister. However, it feels like she is being punished for seeking help with finding a spot for her yoga mat, which is an issue anyone, autistic or not, may have. I suspect this restriction is an attempt to be ""fair to both sides"" when the side of the instructor is clearly the one in the wrong. I'm also getting fed up with the ""don't ask questions"" atmosphere. The owner actually told us questions are encouraged in beginner classes but not any others. What do you guys think? Is any of this normal?",1

"Doing yoga when sick?I saw some videos on YouTube of people doing certain yoga workouts when sick, but was wondering if other people frequently do yoga still while sick? 

I know it's subjective, but I'm currently getting over laryngitis (tested negative for COVID, strep, flu, and RSV), haven't done yoga in almost 4-5 days now, and have been feeling super stiff. I don't have fever, and am currently on steroids to treat my laryngitis, which is slowly helping, but I still have a dry cough and sore chest, so I'm not sure if it's worth it to try and do yoga now, or wait until I feel completely better.

Any insight?",1
"Question - Mid back pain when flat on the floorHi, so I've been doing Yoga with Adriene and I noticed that during some poses where you lie on your back (especially poses where the feet need to be close to buttocks or in the air - for example getting ready for the bridge pose or legs up in the air when lying flat on the back and basically any type of core work when my back is flat on the floor), I get some pain in right mid-back area. It's very localized, always on the same spot, near the spine.

The pain is relieved when I put my hand on the spot that hurts and press on it or massage it a bit and I never feel it during asanas where my back isn't flat on the ground.

Does anybody know what could be the cause for that?",1
"Is there a way to tell if I'll ever be able to do full lotus?I've been experiencing amazing benefits from meditation and have begun sitting for extended periods. I've also started following along to ""Yoga with Adrienne"" as the two practices seem to jive.

However, I'm incredibly inflexible in my hips. I'm 6'2'', and I've got more legs than torso. When I do a deep squat, I have to collapse my back and stretch my hands out in front of me to prevent falling over, and frog pose is one of the most difficult things I've ever done.

Thing is, I really enjoy sitting on a cushion on the floor while meditating. I find a chair far more uncomfortable because I have zero body fat on my rear. Unfortunately, because my hips are so inflexible, getting into quarter lotus, never mind half/full lotus - is a real challenge, and I can feel the strain it puts on my knees and ankles.

I've tried other postures like your bog standard ""criss-cross apple sauce"" and Burmese, but I still have the same ankle/knee strain. I have the most success in Seiza (understandably), but if I sit on my heels my foot falls asleep, and if I'm sitting on a cushion with my legs out to the side, my hips aren't happy.

My question is if there's a way I can tell if my lack of hip mobility is something that I can improve to the point of being able to sit in one of the versions of lotus without the knee/ankle strain, or if there's an anatomical barrier that is physically preventing me from doing so, and I should just accept that I'll be relegated to a meditation bench?

Can I figure this out on my own? Or will I need to see a physiotherapist?",1

"I just had my first 26 x 2 class and WOWI mostly practice vinyasa and some ashtanga here and there but my studio canceled my Thursday AM class while my phone was on dnd and I missed the text so I was thrown into the class as a suprise to me lol! 

The instructor spoke as fast as a auctioneer so I could not make out a lot of his cuing. Additionally he forced my body into certain postures where I have injuries and was already at my edge. 

He personally called me out by name during class to correct postures which I did to my best ability, but would continue to call out to me to correct further, so I’d feel pressure to push past my edge. 

I finished the class and did the best I could, but low key I feel really bad emotionally. And my shoulders are in a bit of pain. It may just be cause it was my first time, but is that typical is the class style? All good, but I love to work hard in yoga and go TO my edge. But this style may just not be for me yet.",1

"Yoga teacher recommendation - Sydney AustraliaHi guys,

I’m male and in my mid thirties and I’ve been doing yoga for about 10 years now but haven’t been going to any formal classes for some time, although I do practice daily at home (if only for 15mins!). I started learning yoga from Eileen Hall at Ashtanga Yoga Moves in Paddington in Sydney (She’s awesome!) but have now moved to the Ryde Area and am looking for a good teacher that can correct my form and deepen my practice. 

I’d describe my level of ability as closer to intermediate (can hold a headstand and lotus pose comfortably but still have some work to do on others).

I can only commit to one day a week on a weekend but it would be nice to get some direction.

I’m happy to travel a bit further if that means going to a more experienced teacher. Any recommendations would be much appreciated!!",1
"What do you all think about shirtless guys?I (31F) practice yoga nearly everyday, and have been going to the same studio for years. Some guys have always gone shirtless for class, which I somewhat get for hot classes where the room gets up to the high thirties (I guess ~98 for the Americans). However now it seems like every guy is always shirtless, even in classes that aren’t heated at all. I honestly hate practicing next to shirtless dudes, I find it gross and distracting lol, and I hate the double standard that me being topless would cause a scene. I’m not here to judge anyone’s fitness level, I’m super happy to practice next to anyone but like, come on man, just no one wants to see that.

I’m tempted to send an email to the studio requesting a shirt-on rule be put in place (I’ve heard of other studios enforcing this), however I feel like it’s kind of a karen-y thing to do and that’s not what I want to come off as. 

Just wondering how you yogis feel about this?

ETA because people seem offended. If I as a woman was to practice topless because I’m sweating, would that not be seen as distracting? Maybe I worded things wrong in my OP but this is to me a huge double standard.",1

"Every lesson I learned from 1 Year of doing yogaI started doing yoga for the first time in Jan. 2022. I've been practicing consistently for just over a year and while I was expecting for my body to benefit from the process (which it has immensely! Better posture, stronger muscles, less aches and pains) what I didn't anticipate is how much I would learn about how to navigate life in a more centered and calmer way. So I'm sharing what I learned in the hope it inspires someone else.


Lesson 1: every big accomplishment starts with a small, insignificant step. Plant the seed today and before you know it, you'll have a giant tree someday. I started doing yoga with just 20 min beginner videos on YouTube one or two days a week and now I'm practicing consistently 3-4 days a week for at least 40 minutes. 


Lesson 2: doing a challenging thing isn't just about endurance and will power. It's about making the steps super easy and accessible for where you are and building from there. I told myself I wanted to do yoga for like 15 years and never did it. The game changer was not worrying about finding a studio or trying to start with an hour long class or even a 30 day ""challenge"" but to start with the bare minimum I was able to and build from there little by little.


This applies to everything from saving money, to making a career, to fixing relationships...the big scary goals are important but just star with the smallest incremental change you can today and add a little more as you can. Before you know it, all those little steps will amount to something much bigger. 


Lesson 3: You don't yet know what your body is capable of. I never imagined my body could feel this strong, this flexible, or that I could do so many yoga positions well in a way that feels better with each practice. 


It makes me wonder what else I'm capable of and just haven't tried or tested myself yet. Learn a new language? Pick up a new skill? Learn a new instrument? Travel more? All of these things (or whatever feels daunting to you today) none of us know where we can get to a year or 5 years from now. But if you keep planting those tiny seeds, who knows what all is possible!


Lesson 4: ""do yoga with the body you have today"" and "" don't take pride in yesterday's body."" I read both of these on this sub, so retroactive thank you to whoever posted them. Not following these gems is how you get injured. Meet your body where it is today, treat it with respect and care and push only as far as it feels safe to do so. That goes for your mind, heart and spirit as well. If you're not up to seeing certain people today or if it feels like it's too much, give yourself grace. That's not to say never challenge yourself! We have to always push ourselves to get better but must do so in a way that protects us from long term damage. 


Lesson 5: yoga isn't about other people and neither is your life. It doesn't matter what others are able to do with their bodies. You are miles ahead of some people and you'll never be able to do what some people can do so effortlessly. But your journey is your own. All that matters is you and your yoga mat. How you show up, that you show up! Each of us are in a different place in our practice, doing it for different reasons, dealing with our own challenge and demons. Support others but don't take comparison into your own practice. 


Lesson 6: you have no idea what the future holds, good or bad. The only guarantee we have and our responsibility is to today's practice. Maybe a year from now, you can do crow or a perfect headstand. Or you may get injured and can only do the simplest of moves. Do your best with your practice today since that's the best way to prep for the future. Your only responsibility is to care for your practice today. It's the mose precious gift you have and the only way you have any control over the future. It's the best way to predict if you'll have a great practice a year from now.


I never expected that doing yoga would change my life as much as it has. Never thought it would make me feel less anxious and more comfortable in my own skin. 


So if you're just starting to practice today or have been a yogi for decades, I'm rooting for you. I hope your practice brings you a stronger mind, body and soul. It certainly has for me. ",1

"A few questions, trying to understand the reality of feeling emotion during or after yoga practice.This is a follow-up to another post in which I expressed the unpopular opinion that feeling emotional during or after yoga practice is a female thing, not necessarily a yoga thing. I got downvoted and sure enough, several apparently male commenters showed up to prove me wrong. So, I analyzed all the comments and found that almost all of the asanas mentioned fall into two categories:   
1. Hip openers or specific asanas that affect the hip area.
2. Heart openers and backbends

This makes sense, because both areas are mentioned in the literature as being associated with emotion, but there is a subtle difference between them.

In Kundalini Tantra, muladhara chakra is associated roughly with the hip area and this is said to be the repository of old hurts, trauma if you will, and the yogi is warned that he/she may have to deal with these things that have been stored in a kind of unconscious memory, potentially carried forward from previous lives in addition to the present lifetime.

In Samkhya-Yoga, the heart center is associated with ananda and anandamaya kosha, which can be thought of as feeling or emotion, but maybe more accurately as passion. We think of passion as intense feelings of love or hatred, and people can have passion for drugs and alcohol, money, and sex. Ego can cause people to feel passionate anger, or a drive to win at all costs. The practice of the heart center is focused not so much on stored emotions but on eliminating those passions mentioned, because they result in a kind of self-caused trauma that plays out through karma. The practice begins with yama and niyama but does not end there.

In my personal experience, I haven't experienced emotion simply as a result of asana, only by *intentionally* working through muladhara chakra. So, to follow-up, I wonder if people would be willing to talk about the *types* of emotions that you feel during or after asana, either while working the hips or the heart? Does the subtle difference that I described align with what you are feeling? Do you think this is just wrong and it's all bio-chemical?",1
"Should I stick to the classes I like or branch out?I have been practicing yoga in some form for around 15 years and have in the few years found ashtanga to be a very structured approach that I really enjoy. 

I like that I know what each class will bring and that I will be challenged by the practice. I’m struggling to get to classes in my area at the moment but have the option to go to slower, freer form restorative classes. My knee jerk response is that I don’t like them. The instructors talk too much while the class is seated or lying down, and I’m not feeling physically challenged. I am mentally challenged by it though. I’m so frustrated by the stillness it makes me almost angry. I have to sit at work all day and something about paying to sit even more in yoga really grinds my gears! 

Is it good for my overall practice to push through the frustration I feel in this slow classes and try and get used to them or should I just stick with what I know I like and practice at home?

"The evolution of music in yogaI began practicing years ago in a more traditional Ashtanga style. Those classes might have had some traditional music, chanting, singing bowls, etc. 

Then I moved for years to a 26/2 practice and of course, there was no music at all.

Now I'm back to a more traditional hot yoga practice and the instructors literally play ALL kinds of music. The modern music was a little jarring at first, and it felt wrong, but I don't mind it at all anymore. 

I'm sure there are some strong opinions on the subject. Let's hear them!",1
"Yoga style/video recommendationsHello everyone, been doing yoga for about 12 days now and it's changed my mood and body aches and I'm addicted. 

Looking for some advice in terms of where to direct my focus

I like doing yoga at home and have found a lot of wonderful videos and I'm expanding my collection. 

The vast majority of videos are basically stretching and shouldn't even be called yoga, no traditional moves at all

I liked more intermediate ones focus on Ashtanga Yoga but I am not there in terms of flexibility and don't want to injure myself

I did some searches on longer holds and Yin and Iyengar popped up. 

I like the philosophy behind these but not a fan of the props or in terms of Yin it just seemed way too easy, although a great way to cooldown. 

I really liked the traditional poses in Bikram but cant' seem to find a video that doesn't focus on the hot yoga aspect and more of the poses. Is there a non-hot yoga Bikram or something that is similar? 

Can someone please suggest videos or a style. I want to improve flexibility and strength.

A bit more of a focus on traditional while still being exercise and not just meditation would be ideal.

"In a challenging class, do you pace yourself? Or do you go 100% to exhaustion?I almost exclusively attend very challenging, advanced, heated classes.

By the end of class, I'm typically, totally exhausted, and may even sit out for a minute or two in child pose toward the end of a hard class.

"yoga teacher training and spinal fusionhi everyone! i wanted to hear thoughts about becoming a yoga teacher even though about 6 years ago (when I was 17y old) i had a fairly substantial spinal fusion for scoliosis. i have some flexibility in my lower back, which is mostly not fused. otherwise, my back is not very flexible at all, leaving positions like wheel, plow, camel, etc. completely out of my practice. anything that requires a significant bend in the upper or mid-back is out of the question for me. i have been practicing yoga consistently for about a year (4-6 times per week) without much of an issue (bridge instead of wheel, sleeping bear or waterfall instead of plow, etc). i’m wondering if it would be realistic to become an instructor because i love it so much!

"Downward facing dog resourcesI have practiced yoga at home on and off for a few years. I am not new to down dog, but it seems that the more I grow, the harder the pose gets. With every tutorial I watch to understand the pose better, I get more confused. I love growing into and discovering a pose, but I keep struggling with my downward facing dog.. My alignment cues right now are:

\- Biceps by the ears

\- Try to relax my head/neck

\- Heart towards the thighs

\- Avoid dumping all the weight into the arms

Now I find myself widening my shoulder blades in down dog to avoid 'crashing into my shoulders'. This seems like a variant of 'shoulders away from the ears'. Since widening my shoulder blades, I noticed more headaches, so I think I am straining too much. And it's difficult for me to distribute my weight into my legs. 

I would really like to hear some advice or resources or alignment tips. I have a slight lumbar scoliosis curve, I am more stiff than I am weak, I'm slightly built. And English isn't my first language so maybe the wording is off.",1

"5:30 am Yoga session update/lessons learnedLinked the original post asking for help 


Thank you all for the help and suggestions. Here is the routine 

8:30 PM - fold up the mat, block, a towel and put them in the car. Unplug charger if the car battery if full. 

9 PM - change into shorts and t-shirt; wear warm clothes on top of shorts and t-shirt 

5 AM - Only one alarm; Alarm has some motivation label to remind me why I need Yoga and how I feel afterwards. This will be the first thing I will see. 

Wake up at 5 after the bathroom trip, make coffee - It takes 2-3 mins but in the mean time clean up kitchen sink. 

By 5:16 ish hop into the car and drive away. Takes 8-10 mins to reach the studio leaving me with few mins to say hellos to fellow yogis and set up the mat and even add a couple of stretches. 

Overall this has been working well. I love 5:30 am sessions - mind and body is fresh. Exercise is done for the day (although I am now adding weights and pull ups slowly during the day). Love the sense of accomplishment! Grateful for the studio that is offering this early morning session and the kind yet serious teachers who are amazing!",1

"I lost ~15 lbs from hot yoga.When I first started doing hot yoga, I researched whether or not it would be a good way to help me lose weight bc after my first class, it undoubtedly felt like a workout. 

However, a lot of what I found basically implied that no, yoga doesn’t burn a lot of calories & while it has other benefits, weight loss is not one of them. 

Well, I started in October, took a month off in November, and then started back up in December (sporadically bc of the holidays & same for January bc life), and when I went to my doctor last week I had lost a little over 15 lbs since the second week of OCTOBER. 

AND I recently did blood work & had high cholesterol which has significantly lowered too. 

I *have* slightly changed how I ate within this time. I no longer crave or eat sugar, I stopped eating out as much & eat healthier / lighter options bc it made no sense to go to these classes if I was stuffed in heavy foods and couldn’t perform in the class, but overall I still eat a lot of what I want to when I want to, just not as often as I did when I wasn’t practicing hot yoga. 

Also, my body is LEAN as hell. I’m not talking like I’ve just loss weight and I’m smaller now, I have more of a defined shaped in the places I desire. 

So. For those of you who feel like hot yoga is a workout, ignore what people say, this shit has changed my mental and physical

Edit: a lot of you keep mentioning the calorie deficit and changing how I eat. I do appreciate explaining this to me but my overall point was that it was HOT YOGA that caused me to change my diet (along w some health concerns), but I really was the fact that there was no point in me going to classes on a full stomach. 

I always ate relatively healthy (don’t eat fast food & enjoy my vegetables, don’t like eating pasta/ excess carbs), but I also was a huge foodie & loved to try new places & as such ate out a-lot. 

With that being said, i weigh the same I do now as I did when I started law school and the bodies are completelyyyyyyyyyyyyyy different, despite being around the same weight. That’s building muscle, bay-bee! 

So yes ofc there were multiple factors to the weight loss, but hot yoga played a HUGE role.",1

"What type of yoga is best for someone with fibromyalgia, hypermobility and vestibular migraines?Hello everyone.  I have what they say is fibromyalgia.  And practice Yin Yoga regularly to help with pain. It works great! However I am also someone who is hypermobile and have dislocated tendons and joints at points in my life, also they think I have vestibular migraines (essentially a migraine that effects your inner ear, so I end up relying on my sense of sight to balance me more than the average person). So I am looking for a form of yoga that systematically strengthens joints in one's whole body, including the feet and hands. Also something that focuses on balance and symmetry.  Previous to finding Yin, I believe what I was doing was some vinyasa stuff, and I found it went too fast (didn't hold poses long enough to feel relief) it also stressed me out that I could never remember the sequence of the breathe when I came back home and would spend some of my time stressing about that. 
Essentially my body needs to be taught what it feels like to hold itself together, other wise it won't,  lol.

My back felt so strange after the standing portion. The instructor said this is normal for a first timer. I found many of these stretches and cues uncomfortable. A lot of the cues were more focused on what shape we were making, opposed to how good the stretch feels.

For example, when we did dancer pose, the students were cued to make a T-shape with their body. I feel this compromises the squareness in the hips, which is what I know to be a safe way to do this pose. There are also no/minimal cues for protecting the lower back in backbends (like tucking the tailbone and encouraging the bend to come from mid and upper back)

The most I've found about Bikram as a physical practice is that it's designed to cut off blood flow in some areas and then allow it to come back. I would like to know more about what makes these 26 poses together so ideal that no one changed it since the 1970s.

I've been trying to find physical therapist perspectives on this, but I can't find anything online. The only criticisms I see against Bikram is the heat (I don't mind the heat, especially during the winter) the founder (duh), and that doing too much of the same poses can be bad for you (duh). 

I like that the class is 90 minutes, but I don't want to do it if it's bad for me. Something about the sequence didn't feel right. I'm used to basic heated flows that are smooth and have fun transitions. I also like iyengar because it just feels very nice and has a strong emphasis on safety and posture. Those are my biases.

Is Bikram actually good for you?",1
"Running impacting Yoga capabilitiesHello - I have been practicing yoga for 6+ years regularly, particularly Vinyasa, Yin and Bikram. 

In the past couple of years I have taken up running and I'm currently training for a marathon (I did one last year too). I've noticed that during the periods of training I become less able to balancing poses and hip openers because my legs/lower part of my body is tight. However when I am not in training I can do them with ease. 

I know that I shouldn't but I am getting very frustrated with myself because I can't go where I know I can go in poses, eg, doing standing head to knee. I know this is an opportunity to practice acceptance and patience with my body but I would also like to get into these poses a little deeper to feel the benefits. 

I do stretch and take lots of salt baths etc which does help. But I was wondering if anyone has any advice or some tried and tested poses that can help loosen things up a little?",1
"The class that merely killed meI 24f live in Houston for over a year and have been trying to find a studio to call home. I go to lifetime and the classes are okay but the heated classes only go up to about 80 degrees and I often see people on their phone which can be really distracting to my practice. I’m also getting ready to attend nursing school so I’m trying to budget. Studios in my area cost around $130-$150 per month which seems a little steep to me. I found this one studio about 30 min away that offers a really great intro price and $90 a month, I bit the bullet and said what the hell.

One thing that really drew me to the studio is that the yoga classes are heated to about 104 degrees. Today was my first day and when I tell you the moment I walked into the class I said what the hell did I just sign up for?! I have never have stepped out of a yoga class in the middle of it but today I didn’t and had to sit outside for about 2-4 minutes before I went back in, when I checked the thermometer it was like 117 degrees but the instructor shut it off the temperature thing shorty after I got back in.

I listened to my body, and I’m grateful I did. That class beat me to my knees, spit on me, and kicked me while i was on the ground. I thought I wouldn’t make it, but I did! I found myself on the other side and I’m so grateful I found that studio! I’ll be back tomorrow morning! Namaste:)",1

"2 months of yoga -- progress check-in and musingsI'm \~50 yrs old.  Starting early December I've been going 2+ times a week to a small studio (w/ a break for holiday travels). 

1. I can now **comfortably** touch my toes with 4 fingers on each hand!  Was barely half-way down my shins at the start.
2. I have a 10-yr old spinal compression injury (anterior crush of L2,L4),.  With much physical therapy after the vertebrae ""healed"", I got back nearly full spinal mobility with minimal discomfort.  Despite being fairly active, it's been slowly degenerating and causing greater discomfort.  I haven't been able to do sit-ups w/o spinal pain for the last year or so. Crunches were questionable.  Now, my core strength has improved enough that **I'm able to do sit-ups again**.
3. I'm not overweight, but, I've still lost a few pounds and I can see muscle definition in my shoulders that I didn't have before.
4. A fellow student turned out to be a nearby neighbor whom I'd never met before.

"How Long Did it Take Your Bodies to Adjust to YogaI’ve been doing yoga at my local studio for about 5 months now, started doing 3 (hour long ish) sessions a week that I pair with cardio on my off days.

I love going so much, it makes me feel so much more at peace and I feel I am becoming a better person because of my practice.

The thing is, I’ve noticed that as I get better at the postures and I’m able to do more, I’m hungry for more and more progress. 

I’ve noticed my body changing, including gaining muscle mass that allows me to do things I couldn’t before, but I still feel like I’m too weak to do more advanced postures.

"I just wanted to share my late night writing with yogis❤️.Heal. Healing. 
I was listening to music and in my own way meditating.  

I think one of the things I’m trying to pull away from myself is this constant need for immediate gratification. 

I’ve always been an artist. 
Maybe not capital letter Artist. 
But I think that’s what my soul is. 
So in a way really capital ARTIST.

Sitting here at my sewing machine really reminded me of that. It also highlights how incredibly impatient i am. I want the finished image right away. 

I think this is why I am so drawn to A.I. 
My thoughts made manifest. Is literally the tittle of a folder I keep all my crazy ideas in. 

The other truth about being an artist(soul) is that it makes you incredibly vulnerable…

Vulnerability this word I’ve grown to love. But like just now. Growing to love. 

I think it’s a shame that vulnerable people have to cocoon themselves from the world.  Or it’s a shame that I have cocooned myself from the world. 

Highlighting the word cocoon. (I’ve said it multiple times this weekend)

What being vulnerable in my brain means is this passive internal desire to want to feel the world through other people’s eyes. Or having the capacity to.  

Sometimes I’m looking at myself through someone else’s lens. Not just someone but like everyone. Sometimes at the same time. 
And the kaleidoscope of opinions the negative, the positive, the love, the frustration. 

Then I get scared . I go back into my cocoon. 

Everything above is a congruent tangent. 

This is the result:

In one of my repeated cycles of this, my curiosity to make sure I’m making other people happy led me to read one of my reviews..  

And it wasn’t even one my own that caught me. 

“This class was extremely crowded, I could barely do the poses without touching someone” 

This reminded me of a time this past week where my class was so full I had to parallel my Mat to make sure all 28 of us could fit in the space the size of my mother bedroom.  I remember teaching chair pose at one point and was nose to nose with a yogi.

This gave me so much anxiety
But what it should have given me was joy. 
Here I am in this big ass city doing the thing I love. In a room with like minded people.. and all I could think was. 

I hope they like this. I hope what I have to offer is good enough. 
Vulnerability become insecurity so easily. 
But it is also my strength. 
And in that room I share, I share my movements, my words, my music. 

I still hold back, literally afraid of my own potential. 

I have diagnosed ADHD .. so again this is a tangent but in my mind somehow connected. 

We’ve been so conditioned to not touch our neighbors, not to feel people, not to let other people feel us, see us. 

See us fail. (This seems important)


We’ve lost community. 
But we are healing… 
We are gaining it back. 



I will be starting all my classes off from now on with look to the left and the right of you. Say hi to your neighbor. You might say hi to their toe later 

I had a friend say recently that she says the words “I love you” more freely now because why shouldn’t she love another person. We should love everyone. Why not

What exactly does it mean to maintain your practice outside of yoga?I’m sorry for the ill informed or nooby question but I just started doing yoga classes about 3 weeks ago and I absolutely fell in love with it. I was always a meditative and spiritual individual but jumped into it with the intention of offering myself an additional sense of balance and solidarity. However at the end of these classes I keep hearing the yogi instructor reminding us to carry yoga throughout our everyday lives and the classes are just a part of the journey. My take on this is that we should carry the mental lessons we learn in yoga throughout our days but my question is does this also refer to the physical aspect? Keeping our posture straight? Breathing calmly? Etc. thanks!,1

"Becoming an instructor in a rural/conservative area?Hi all!
I’ve done yoga off and on for about 10 years and I love it so much. About 18 months ago I  moved to my hometown which is very small, VERY isolated, and politically/socially conservative. This is an agricultural (mostly cattle and grain) community in the American west. 

For awhile there was a yoga studio but I attended a few classes and the instructor seemed very undereducated and frankly it all felt kind of irresponsible. However, her classes were popular with the young women in town. She had weekly “wine & Mat” nights where they would drink and do yoga … is this a thing? It’s just not how I practice yoga.

She has since shut down and I realized that I’m in a position where I could take a Yoga Teacher Training and offer classes, not so much to make money but to offer something to the community that I find valuable, while also filling the void that I have without access to classes.

However, I’m curious if anyone has experience with teaching in this type of environment. Would yoga be taken seriously, or only ever seen as a cute gimmick? 

I really appreciate any thoughts you all can share. Thank you!

EDIT::

Thank you everyone for your thoughtful replies! The overwhelming consensus is to go for it. Everyone needs yoga. I guess I knew this, but wanted to hear your input and am super grateful. I still haven’t decided to take the plunge but will try not to worry about these particular things anymore. Thanks again!",1
"A man tickled my foot in a yoga classSigh. I’ve been going to the same studio for over 10 years on and off. I’m currently in an on period.

There’s an older man (in his late 60s probably) who knows all the instructors, is friends with everyone… but has always given me the creeps so I’ve generally steered clear of him. I can tell some of the instructors are kind to him but in a professional way.

Today I was in a workshop and he was in front of me and accidentally touched my foot (which made sense given the posture). Accidental touches between students happen all the time so this isn’t notable. But then he… as a joke seemingly… proceeded to tickle my foot after this accidental touch. 

I promptly yanked my foot away. I hate when people I KNOW tickle my feet. It made me angry and deeply uncomfortable for the rest of the workshop. At the end I told him “you tickled my foot and it made me uncomfortable” for which he apologized and said it wasn’t appropriate and he shouldn’t have done that.

What bothers me is I definitely do not think he would have done that if I was a man. I feel okay about it now, after bringing it up, but it’s still sort of bothering me and I don’t know if I should say something to the studio. What would they even do but tell him not to do that again, which I feel he probably now understands. I just feel like a line was crossed and anyway I parse it it’s just really not okay that he did that.

"Blocks & No BindsEdits: updated info for context from some comments …

* the studio I go to can be quite packed from time to time so during hot yoga classes especially when you’re very close proximity it’s hard not to notice if someone is audibly struggling with their breath or physically shaking. This does not bother me, I know everyone has different bodies, abilities and practice which is what makes yoga great.

* we have a very friendly and collective studio. If I had decided to say something it would’ve been polite but I know it’s not my place so I didn’t and wouldn’t. It’s nice to say hi to your neighbours before you practice together. I believe it makes for a better and more in sync practice. We’re all flowing together and creating energy collectively. 

* “focus on your own mat” I started practicing in NYC, at times those classes can be so packed I’ve literally had a foot to the face before. So I’ve learned to always be aware of my surroundings. It’s also a wonderful feeling when the class is in sync and flows together in a vinyasa. Feels like being part of a collective. I also really enjoy that teachers at our studio come to other teachers classes and watch them or more advanced yogis during class to adjust my stance. Observing others during class has always improved my practice. Furthermore it’s a lovely sentiment to pretend you don’t have a monkey mind and I know that’s what we all work towards in yoga.. I’m on the spectrum, I have adhd and severe ocd. The fact I’m able to quietly practice for an hour and show up on my mat to me is something to be proud of. But I’m not going to pretend my mind doesn’t wander or I’m not occasionally aware of people next to me. I’m not gawking at them. I’m quite overly observant in all aspects of my life and it’s invaluable to my job. I always bring it back to my breath and work on being present. This is why I practice yoga and it is a great help. 


Does it hurt anyone else to see people in class straining to touch the mat or bind when they’re not there yet? I still use the blocks to adjust some days if I’m not feeling as limber… it’s important to get the pose posture right (length, hips etc) than touching the floor or straining a bind. I’m sure people are potentially injuring themselves and getting less out of what the pose is supposed to achieve. I almost said something to someone after class because I was genuinely worried.",1

my question relates to the tree pose.

I find it a lot easier if the tip of my balancing foot is not aligned with my gaze but instead points slightly outward. This is generally the case with balance poses, when i start wobbling about in one,  I will instinctively put my balance foot out a bit and restabilize a bit.

Should I just force it by spending more time in updog? Are there poses that I can try to work it out?

"Is it usual/healthy for one to just let their arms hang when relaxed and upright?Or is it ""normal"" for your arms to be elevated just a bit because of some amount of resting tension in your shoulders?

After a whole (~50y) lifetime I realized that I have tension in my shoulders basically all the time and have become accustomed to having my shoulders just a bit hunched, always.

Now I've managed to become aware of this and relax and stretch to the point where I really truly can let my arms hang 100% by gravity.

But it *HURTS*. It is what one might call a ""nice"" kind of muscle-stretching pain that your are still compelled to do more of. It's getting to be less painful and I can't believe what life is like with a relaxed shoulder+arm area. It's nice.

But I don't want to injure anything or get accustomed to something that _isn't_ really healthy?

"Bad yoga instructor or bad studio/management?I recently took a yoga class at a newly opened studio nearby and had a bad first impression of it. I can't figure out whether it's worth mentioning this to the studio (they asked for my review) because it could just be me and my expectations and someone else could enjoy it. 

I attended a candlelight yoga flow session in a heated studio. Or at least that's what it said when I booked. I arrived and completed all the paperwork prior to arriving but they still made the fill out the same forms when I arrived on paper which was time-consuming. I went to the bathroom to change and it was visibly dirty and very cold. I thought nothing of it at that moment and proceeded to enter the yoga room. The candlelight in this scenario was basically non-existent. The room was bright and cold. There was no heat. I didn't drop a single sweat during the class. On top of this, the class was playing pop music like Justin Bieber and Calvin Harris. The instructor, to top it all off, seemed not very experienced. There was no flow and we basically did intro and outro stretches for 1hr. All of the poses were very repetitive and at some points, we were holding the stretching positions for 1-2mins, it was almost like the instructor couldn't come up with what to do next and stalling time. I left this class 10mins earlier to join another session at a different studio and I felt like I was lied to and robbed of my time. I felt very frustrated and wished I had left earlier than to wait if we were going to ""start"" the class. 

This yoga studio costs over $150/mo (usual price in our city - DC)  but did not deliver the quality or the standards and I feel like I should let others know before they pay this $$ and be disappointed in the service like me.

The instructor started the class with a lot of standing and balancing postures. But i had to lay down or sit for sometimes because the heat was a lot. I also found it a bit difficult to breathe at times cause it was so stuffy. There were a few moments when I was scared I was going to pass out. How is this relaxing? I personally did not feel too safe because I felt scared that I would pass out. I took breaks but sometimes was still a lot. Then we moved to laying down postures which was so much easier and she gave us time to rest in between. I liked laying down so much more. Overall, it was okay.

"Story time: Fart YogaIt was my third yoga teacher training and this time, my journey took me to South America. 

For 6 weeks, all they fed us was rice, beans, and potatoes. 

As you can imagine, our yoga room got pretty smelly each class with loud farts often breaking through the zen silence. 

And it didn’t help that our teachers liked to give extremely descriptive full body relaxation cues that included the phrase “relax your anus”.

So one day we broke into practice teaching groups. 

My group was fortunately outside. 

It was my turn to teach first and so I stepped up to the front and began my class.

Just to be silly and make my classmates laugh, I slid a “relax your anus” into the beginning of class.

The second I said it, one of my students intentionally ripped the loudest fart I’ve ever heard. 

In response, I let one out that I’d been holding in. 

Then they echoed around the group of us until we were all crying and laughing on the ground. 

Eventually, we all composed ourselves and I continued teaching. 

But we couldn’t stop. 

Every pose was a ripple of farts we were finally free to let out. 

And every fart led to another ripple of laughter until the hour was over and we were all bonded for life by our communal farts.

I was completely safe in the poses, for example side angle using my forearm over thigh rather than extending my arm down, etc. She seemed offended that I was taking modifications. At one point she came over and began twisting my neck In gomukhasana even through I never gave consent to touch me. I’ve always practiced that pose looking straight ahead. There were also just weird transitions like ardha Chandrasana step back to crescent lunge. At least for me felt unnatural. And our savasana was about 30 seconds.

"Starting to feel like my hot vinyasa class isn't challenging me in the right ways.I've been doing yoga pretty consistently for about 6 years and around a year ago, I found a hot vinyasa class I loved. The instructor only teaches at the studio once per week, and her class became pretty popular.

I only mention this because in the beginning, it was a mixed bag of people of all different levels. But since it's gotten popular, more and more advanced yogis have joined the class and she's tailored the pace and poses to meet their skill level. I'm pretty comfortable with modifying, but this brings me to my second problem...

As the class has gotten more challenging, it's also gotten hotter. I don't know if this was a choice by the teacher, an issue with the heating, or if the class is right after another hot class. It could also be due to the fact the class is always so full. I've been going to hot classes for 4 years and have never experienced anything like this.

It's not at all uncommon for more than half the class to be in child's pose from about halfway through. At first, I felt challenged to keep pushing myself, but it feels like it's gotten to the point where I'm hitting a wall. I feel like I don't even have a chance to try out the more advanced poses because by the time they come, I'm so exhausted from the heat. It's been about three months since the temperature bizarrely got turned up, and I'm just not adjusting. I'm starting to wonder whether it's holding my practice back because I can never physically push myself in poses.

I'm pretty torn over this. I love the class and instructor, and there's a nice community vibe in the class... I don't know whether I'm getting frustrated on an ego level or if I'm genuinely not aligned with the class anymore.

Has anyone experienced something like this? Any advice would be super appreciated!",1

I'm happy to say I finished my 30-day yoga challenge from YWA! I really did learn a lot and I really noticed how much benefit I got from waking up a bit earlier and starting my day with 20 minutes of yoga.

That being said, my mobility is still very limited and some of the poses Adrienne showed were just too advanced for me.

So now, I'm wondering what I could do next...

I guess I could do another 30 day challenge with Adrienne. I know how she works and I like her style. But I might up for something more structured, maybe something that focuses more on progression through different poses and flexibility? Or is that not a thing in yoga?

And another question, to really make progress, is it recommended to continue with a daily practice or rather 3-4 times/ week, to let the body rest a bit?

I know there are TONS of other teachers out there but beyond Adrienne I have no clue who is actually good value and who isn't.

So any help or experiences would be very much appreciated!

EDIT: Oh yeah, I'm looking for something between 20-30 minutes, per session.

"I feel anxious about returning to a studioWhen I moved to my city last year, I found an amazing studio. I loved it. The vibe, the energy, the teachers. It was small when I joined, sometimes it’d be just me - they’ve blown up a bit since. It’s cool though. It’s a young, hip sort of vibe. It leans into spirituality which I’ve always loved - Om chants, breathwork classes, etc. I’ve never gotten into studios that are more into the fitness side of it. 

And they just love yoga. Everyone there practices daily. It’s family run, they make an effort to know you. They always try to get you to double up on classes (ie 5:30 vinyasa and stay for the yin). For me though, I’ve struggled with my practice. On again, off again. For years. Lately I’ve been in maybe an 8 month fitness rut due to money issues, then a new insane job, etc. 

I left the studio late summer last year. Money was rough. And I felt weird there sometimes. It’s a very diverse studio, and sometimes I felt I was infiltrating a safe space. Sometimes I felt like I didn’t have friends despite how friendly people were. Sometimes I felt I didn’t deserve to be there. I’m quiet, I’m weird. I’m overthinking. I had to poke and prod a bit to get out of the monthly commitment.

There were teachers I felt I failed. One in the Wednesday class emphasized how I was a regular in her class. Then poof I’m gone. They did reach out a few times, but I felt lousy answering. I’m sure they were just reaching out back to old clients anyways - I’ve been in that business. A few months ago as well I tried a new studio and just didn’t like it. 

Part of me wants to go back. And part of me feels like a quitter. Part of me thinks I didn’t or shouldn’t be there. They always said how important daily practice was and I bailed. I don’t know how long I’d last again, but I miss my practice and money is better. I’m not sure if I have a question exactly but it feels weird , the thought of going back and if it’s worth it. I’m just super shy, don’t want to be an issue or someone they think is a quitter or anything.

Idk. I realize they think nothing of me. It’s a business. It’s all in my head. But I guess I’m wondering if anyone had any advice",1

"suggestions for building up to ashtangaHi all. I’m really wanting to start learning yoga. I was in ballet for 13 years and am moderately active and still flexible. I *think* i want to do ashtanga, however from what I understand that’s not a good move for a beginner. So where should I start to be able to eventually do ashtanga? Personally, I don’t think I would need to start at the very beginning with restorative, as I understand movement and have good flexibility. But please tell me if i’m wrong!! I only know some basic beginner poses so i’m here to ask where you suggest i begin :)

edit: i also am totally new to the mindfulness and inner connection with yoga, not just the physical aspect",1
"For the first time, I walked out of a yoga classI’ve been practicing yoga on and off for 15+ years. I’m nowhere near a pro but I’m also not new to it. Occasionally, I’ve attended a class where a student will start rolling up their mat in the middle of class and walk out. Today I was that person. Here’s why:

First, the instructor was incredibly flexible and strong, but had seemingly little knowledge of how most peoples’ bodies move. The instructor provided no options for modifying incredibly difficult and advanced moves. I know modifications for some yoga poses, but by the time they gave cues for one posture, they were already on to the next. Which brings me to reason #2. 

The instructor moved through postures at lightning speed. For my body, dangerously fast. By the time my brain comprehended what the instructor was asking us to do, they were already on to the next pose. If I wanted to breathe through each pose, I would need to be hyperventilating. Example: Downward facing dog to plank to chaturanga to upward facing dog and back to downward facing dog in the span of about 5 seconds. This was much faster than any of the faster-paced yoga styles I’ve heard of (eg power yoga). One of the major reasons I do yoga is the breathing helps to ground me and really helps me focus on something other than the difficulties/stresses of daily life. 

This is NOT a rant post. I genuinely feel bad for leaving the class, and I want to know if maybe there is another (much faster) yoga style that I’ve just never encountered until today. 

FWIW, there was half an hour of class left. I didn’t feel comfortable doing my own thing while they instructed everyone else, nor did I want to stay in child’s pose for that long. What would you have done?",1
"Looking to diversify beyond Yoga With AdrieneLooking for YouTube instructors who are more diverse in every aspect….gender diversity, body diversity, ethnic diversity, technique, etc.

Working up to handstands?I’ve been doing yoga off and on for a few years and I’m wondering if anyone has tips on ways to work up to handstands.

"Mood after leavingI’m new to yoga. I started a little over a month ago and have been going 3 times a week since. I have loved every minute of it and I’m always looking forward to going. It’s always led to me feeling so much better physically and mentally. However, tonight wasn’t quite the same. The stretches and poses felt much harder and it was impossible to stay focused with my mind wandering more than normal. By the end of class, I left feeling depressed.  Granted, one of my main focuses for starting was the mental benefits, along with physical, but mostly I found myself seeking a better handle of my stress and mental anguish. Life, as of late, has been incredibly stressful with working full time, going to school, and making sure I’m not neglecting my family. The last few days have left me in a mental state that I can only describe as “off” or even disconnected. But practice tonight seemed to open a flood gate of depression.  Has anyone else experienced this?",1
"Toe Cramps - New to YogaSo I’ve been doing yoga twice a week for a few weeks now and noticed I get a toe/ foot cramp when the top of my foot is laying on the mat or plantar flexion some would call it too.

"Recovery for Sore and Stiff Muscles after Yoga.A little background:  5 years ago I practiced yoga 5 or 6 times each week.  Life got busy and I left my mat for a few years,  but began practicing again 6 months ago.  I'm 44 (F), in reasonable shape, reasonable weight, fairly active lifestyle and I eat well, drink water, etc etc.  So basically healthy.

Somehow I feel like I turned 44 and middle age has set in and my muscles don't recover from anything anymore.  I'm doing fairly gentle practices for 45 minutes 4-5 times a week, but my muscles are constantly stiff and sore.  The yoga feels so good for my body, but later in the day and the evening, my body hurts.

Does anyone have a suggestion of vitamins or supplements or foods that may help with muscle recovery?  I know my Iron and Vitamin D levels are a little low.  I've recently added chia seeds to my diet to see if that helps.

"App with detailed instructions for beginner?I am not able to go to an in person studio. I have been using the Down Dog app, and I am quite happy with it. Except, that I sometimes need more instructions on how to modify a pose. Like, if I can't do it the same way the person on screen does it, I'd like to know how to adjust it to my skill level. Is it more important to keep my leg straight, or is it more important to bend over farther? I tried the sleeping pigeon position for the first time today and didn't know if keeping my hips level was the main goal, and if so, what so I need to do with the rest of my body to modify it. 

I don't mind paying for an app. I don't even need it to have full sessions like down dog (but fine if it does). More like encyclopedia of yoga poses for beginners and what to focus on first.

"Seeking advice for improving child’s poseHi fellow yogi friends, I am struggling with adjusting myself during child’s pose. 

I can’t get my butt on my heels when my hands are reaching above my head and touching the floor. (The traditional pose) It feels like I have to push through my hands and the floor to get my heels closer to my butt when I do it like this. Then I don’t really feel anything on my lower back because it’s too much pressure through my hands, maybe? And my upper back is pushing too hard…? 

I’ve seen some people do the pose with their head on a block, what are the benefits of this? Does this better stretch your lower back without the pressure through your hands?

What about if I put my arms alongside my thighs so  my hands cup the heels of my feet? When I do this, it feels too heavy in my head doing this. Like there is too much weight on the upper half of my body. 

Is there any changes I can make or any equipment that can help with this? I’m not sure what I’m supposed to be feeling or where I’m meant to feel this pose. 

I’d love to hear your advice and input about changing up the pose to feel it differently in different places of my body. Help!",1
"Postponing moksha (liberation)Hi,  


How do you know you're getting closer to liberation and how do you postpone it?  


In my case, life really didn't start until I was 29. Born in a broken home, stunted emotionally, I've never been in a relationship (32 now). Spiritually, however, there were some great strides; I live in a permanent state of background stillness, emotions, such as anger and grief come and go, dissolve moments before they get to me and cause damage.   


Intuitively, I know what the next steps are in the spiritual journey but overcoming the ego is difficult. After introspection, I realized that unfairness strengthens while reason diminishes it.   


The ego is willing to ""surrender"" if a normal life (born into a family with loving parents that allow for building healthy relationships with others) is guaranteed in the next or has already happened in one of the past ones.   


Trying to circumvent it by any other means creates numbing headaches, nausea and my left side of the body to burn as if I stood outside on summer sunny afternoon with no sunscreen.

Both times I responded with, “There are so many good teacher here!”

"Too much pressure on AC joint while using yoga headstand/inversion bench?I recently got a [yoga headstand bench](https://www.theyoganomads.com/yoga-stools/), and have enjoyed using it so far. Earlier this week, however, I felt some discomfort in my left AC joint (shoulder) after using it. I possibly wasn't supporting myself enough with my arms and left too much weight where my shoulders meet the bench. In any case it was a mild discomfort so I shook it off and felt normal the rest of the day.

The next morning the same shoulder was a bit sore, but I assumed I had just slept on it weird. Then during the first downward dog of my morning practice I felt a sudden hot pain in my left AC joint. I have reduced mobility and am pretty sure I sprained it. At the time I stopped and haven't put pressure or over extended the joint since then, and it's definitely getting better.

"Yoga changes your body in a way that lastsI really love hearing about people’s “first time I …” because some 15 years ago that was me. I could never touch my toes, I could never sit in padmasana (lotus), and I could never touch my hands behind my back in gomukhasana (cow-face). It took me YEARS to get to these — in the end I was practising up to 4-5 days a week and broke down quite a lot of the physical blockages around my body in shoulders, hips, neck, and back. (Although I never quite made it to full hanumanasa.)

Then I got married and had kids, and work got busier and busier. And my yoga practice slowly, then quickly, disappeared. I was assuming that all my efforts would be quickly undone and my body would revert to its old stiffened form.

I am now starting to get aches and pains, and of course I’m out of shape (and a few kg heavier), but I don’t think I could have physically made it through the last 7 years without the baseline level of strength and flexibility that yoga gave me.

Would love some input or guidance.I went to a ""rebalancing"" class on Tuesday at my local studio which I normally love, but afterwards I felt so low, I felt emotionally ""shattered"".  Like... I couldn't help but start crying randomly that evening and even the following day.  

It's been two days now and I still feel this lingering sadness.  Just a little about me, I went through a fair bit of trauma as a child and teenager which made a lot of my adult life feel unsafe and threatening.   I also quit my job after a fairly large windfall last year, although it's not enough to retire forever.  I sort of feel like I am going through a huge shift in my identity (going from relying on working for someone else to finding my own way).  To add to the shift in identity, I split with my partner of 7 years about 7 months ago, and I moved to a new town by myself about 3 months ago.

I absolutely LOVE yoga, I've rarely been drawn to anything like this in my life, and I want to continue practicing, but I don't know if I can go back to that class for a while as those emotions were too much too fast and it was honestly debilitating.  


I feel like some of you may ask this, so I will say  that I have been going to therapy and I am starting EMDR therapy tomorrow.  

Intuitively, it feels as though maybe Yoga is speeding up the process of stripping away my old identity as well as resurfacing old trauma, but that I may need to use it sparingly as I make these adjustments, so I think I will experiment with doing just a little bit here and there for now at my own pace/ at home.  


I wanted to ask you all if you had any advice/opinions/insights on this as there is not a ton that comes up online when I search it.   


TL;DR   
Overwhelming sadness lasting (so far) 2 days after a Yoga class that I normally enjoy,  Just wondering if anyone has had similar experiences/ insights or opinions on what I should do or how to handle this as I love Yoga, and I don't want to stop practicing all together.",1
"Newby, my city started donation based classes, I love the yoga class but have wrist pain, help?It’s a baptiste yoga class, tbh it’s not too beginner friendly, I just went for the experience and it was awesome, I felt so good after!! Except my wrist, I’ve had wrist issues for a long time, ganglion cysts etc. what can I do to help the pain besides Advil? Anyone else experience this? I can’t use padding bc my yoga mat was too padded and I could NOT do a tree pose lol",1
Is this an om? And if so what style? I’ve looked online but can’t find anything exactly like it 🤔thanks!,1
How to clean wax from yoga mat??? HelpTwo months ago I accidentally dropped a candle on my yoga mat... Candle was burning and all wax was liquid and it spills all over my mat... wax dried immediately and I was too annoyed to clean it then so I just leave it and used my other less favourite mat... recently I tried to clean it with wet wipes but it didn't go away and I really want to clean it but I just don't know what to do... my mat is of some sponge/gum material and its hard to rub it with knife or something. Does anyone have any idea of how I could clean it??,1
"Cold shower after yoga? Good or bad?Hey guys,  


This year I wanna start doing a morning routine, to develop discipline and do more yoga. I was thinking of doing 60 minutes of Jivamukti Spiritual Warrior class and then taking a cold shower.  


I've heard yogi's say it's very important to keep the heat generated by your yoga session in your body, and not cool off too fast. Is there any truth in this, or anything in the scriptures?",1
"AHHH! I can finally touch my toes for the first time ever!!I may or may not have celebrated with a silly victory dance while my very confused dog stared with judgement before happily joining in on the party. No regrets! 

Phew! So with that excitement out of the way here's a quick back story. I just turned 30 a few months ago and went into it with the mindset of making this my best decade.This year I want to do more for my body and mental wellbeing so I signed up for YWA's annual January challenge. Previously I've done fairly dedicated flexibility work but never managed to reach further than my ankles even with daily practice and gave up some time mid last year. So my flexibility progress more or less reset. 

I want to prove to myself that I can be disciplined and reach some goals after consistently having setbacks. I haven't missed a single YWA video this month and went from touching just past my knees at the beginning of the challenge to my toes today! I knew it was possible but I thought for sure it'd take much longer than three weeks. Yoga made it happen and it's also super relaxing and fun! I'm so proud of myself and ready to tackle the next goal! 

TL;DR: I can touch my toes for the first time at 30 and it feels amazing!",1
"How to not feel like yoga is another thing on my to do listI started getting back into my yoga practice in the fall. When I moved in October I paused my studio membership to not have the extra financial burden during that time. I’ve come off of freeze and I’m just so busy and have so little time. I work full time at an orangetheory fitness and haven’t even taken class there in almost 4 weeks. I’m also studying for my MCAT so that’s where any extra time an energy outside of work goes.

I know I need some yoga in my life for some stress reduction and self care. But trying to plan when I can take a class just feels like another thing to check off the list at this point so I’m not motivated to make it a priority. Any tips?",1
"Are there poses that you're still having difficulties with even after years of practice?It's my 10th year of doing yoga (yay!). In the beginning, I practiced weekly and then it became at least twice a day. Pandemic happened and I started skipping days but I still try to practice consistently. After 10 years, I still can't do the crow pose and other arm balances but I'm happy with my yoga journey.",1
"corepower for beginnersare corepower classes suitable for beginners? keep in mind, i’m not just a beginner at yoga. i’m also extremely weak, and i can’t even do a single push up. i haven’t properly worked out in a while. i’m okay in terms of flexibility.",1
"Should I ask out my longtime crush from yoga class?I've been practicing with my current main yoga instructor for almost 5 years now. Over the last few years, I've developed a pretty big crush on this one girl in my class. We have both followed the instructor to different studios, and at times it has just been the two of us in class. She has always been very friendly and open whenever I strike up a conversation, but I have been hesitant to approach her romantically or confess my feelings. I have dated other people over the years and brought a few of them to class, but my heart keeps coming back to her. It's now to the point where this is really eating at me, and I just can't stop thinking about her.

To begin with, I can feel self-conscious being one of the only guys in class, and absolutely do not want to be seen as the creep who is there just to hit on women. I take my practice very seriously, and after spending hours reading other threads about this topic, it seems a lot of people feel that the studio is a sacred space and not a place to express such desires. She is extremely beautiful and I'm sure she gets hit on all the time outside of class. Obviously I am very physically attracted to her and it's hard not to let my eyes wander at times, but the more we talk the more I come to enjoy her personality and appreciate our common interests. The last thing I want to do is make her uncomfortable or scare her away from our favorite instructor.

I'm now in a position where I'm leaving for a year-long sabbatical in a few months, so I feel like perhaps the ship has sailed, but at the same time I do not want to be an old man looking back at this with the deep sense of regret that I now feel. I feel like lately she has almost expressed signs of interest in me - for example this week our instructor posted some videos of us playing music, and she complimented my playing and said she's always finding out new cool things about me. But then on the other hand she encouraged me to go to a class yesterday with a happy hour after, so I really psyched myself up about it, and then she and her friends left right after class ended. At our main class she is always alone, but in general she usually doesn't linger after class and most of our conversations happen beforehand. Also I tend to err too far on the side of playing it cool, and sometimes get nervous and avoid talking to her which might have sent mixed messages. That did kinda happen yesterday :\\

What would you all do in my situation? As of now I am leaning towards just going with the flow and then confessing my feelings right before I go abroad, saying that maybe if the timing is right when I'm back we can go out, but that also feels kind of silly.",1
"Tips for lotus pose?I've been putting both feet on the top of my thighs towards the hips and I keep by back straight. It feels totally fine so far, I don't feel like I'm straining, but I want to make sure I'm doing it correctly so I don't injure myself. I'm reading conflicting things online, some say it's safe to do for long periods of time, some say it wears out your joints. I find it to be a very enjoyable pose, so I'd like to do it often.",1

"Need tips to resume yoga after a long months break and a mental blockI(30f) did yoga 1 hour 5 days a week for 9 months straight and loved it. Then ended up on a 3 months break that was not intended. 
I went on a long vacation, contracted covid, gained a few kilos binging on food, been out of shape and strength in these last 3 months. Even developed some knee pain and frequent back pain to seal the deal. Also a bigger tummy than ever before. I feel very scared and underconfident to start again. Overthinking that I won't be able to do all the asanas that I had learnt. I was almost on the verge of managing natrajasana. I used to have no arm strength before and was finally able to balance a few seconds in Shirsasana and bakasana. But everything went down the drain after the break. Too scared to find out my strength levels now. I am VERY inconsistent with hobbies and I was very proud of the streak I had achieved with Yoga. Feels like over reaction as I type all this. 

Every night I think I'll do a light session tomorrow morning or contact my instructor again. But something is holding me back. I really want to get moving and working out. Would like your suggestions and motivation.",1
"Small wins - ImprovisingSo, I had a period where I did yoga everyday for a few months. Then my routine flagged, and I was able to do it a few times a week for a few more weeks, and eventually I stopped regularly practicing. I might throw a sun salutation into other stretching, but I wasn't really exercising either. 

I came back to yoga earlier this week, but I couldn't bring myself to find a YT video or routine to follow, so I just...started. I improvised around the goal of getting in a full body stretch and some pre-bedtime meditation. I gradually worked from standing to laying, getting in the twists and stretches that I like and working around my body. AND IT FELT GREAT! The meditation honestly went so much better too, than trying to follow along with somebody else's goals or intentions for the video. 

I feel like this is really a breakthrough for me (with newly diagnosed ADHD) - the ability to just show up and work on things as I want will be really helpful to not feel like there is a burden to plan another thing. I also felt like I stayed much more naturally moving with my breath going at my own pace and knowing where my poses were to catch my breath and think ahead, which felt way better too. I absolutely still think there is a place for using other routines/aids to add to my repertoire, to work up to specific goals, to check my form against, etc. But this will also help keep that fresh and interesting to come back to every week or so to see how things are changing for me. 

Overall, I'm very excited for this next step for me.",1
10 YOGA POSES FOR IMPROVING YOUR COLON HEALTH,1
"Spine Surgery YogaGood morning all!

I had a C 4/5 and C 5/6 artificial disk replacement done in December 2021. I went through various physical therapies from February 2022 until early December 2022. These included traditional pt, aquatic therapy, dry needling, aromatherapy, and the use of a TENS Unit at home along with other tools. 

My girlfriend has been taking me to her Yin Yoga class lately and it’s been a great help to the muscle tension I still suffer from in my neck and trapezius area especially. 

Can anyone recommend any other classes that would be easy enough physically where I could do the poses, but tough enough to give me a workout targeted to the neck/upper back region?

Thanks in advance!",1

"tricks and tips on kechari mudra?I've been practicing for a few months now and I can't  pass my uvula. I'm aware that it takes time and practice. My tongue isn't really long so I focus on stretching.

Anyone here achieved the full kechari mudra? Is it necessary to get a frenotomy in some cases?

"CrowgaI am looking for some clarity wiith Bakasana. There are two differing schools of thought with crow - that *the arms are as low as possible on the triceps, or that they are as high as possible*. From what I understand the major difference between Crow and Crane is this knee position, and the lower knee position (±an inch from the elbows) is proper form for crow - the reasons being it allows the yogi to pull the ankles closer to your glutes and thus form a clean line through the ankles, knees, and wrists.

Anyhow, I am hoping to put this to bed once and for all. Tons of people seems to do it in different forms online without a ton of consistency, and I am a little too green in terms of knowledgeable resources to know what the correct alignment is. 

For what it's worth, Breathe and Flow yoga are proponents of this lower knee form, and they seem to be fairly committed to detail in their practice.

Edit: to clarify, I am looking specifically for form with respect to the knee position ( as high vs as low as possible) in crow. The arm position will differ in Crane (straight) vs. Crow (bent) and cause a natural shift in the knee position on the arms.",1
"Crunching in lower back after yoga normal?I have a herniated disc in my lower back and yoga has really helped me alleviate the pain by helping me drop weight and strengthen my core.

"Inspired by another post! What prompts do you love and find helpful during yoga class?I’ll start: one time I had a yoga instructor that went into great detail about “pushing the earth away from you” while in downward dog, and I started visualizing planet Earth out there floating around in space, and little me in downward dog literally pushing that earth away with my hands and feet. 

Also, an honourable mention to Adriene Mischler’s prompt about “an upward current of energy up the front, and a downward/grounding current of energy down the back” (for mountain pose). She has so many good ones.",1

"Delayed back spasms (at night or even the next day) any time I do twistsHi, I'm a beginner to yoga (less than a year of practice) and running into some issues any time I do twists.

The twists always feel great when I'm doing them and even after I've cooled down, but then either that night when I'm in bed, or sometimes even the following night, I get very painful back spasms in my upper back.

Has anyone experienced this, or have any ideas on how to ease this? I've taken to barely moving into twists, but at that point I'm not feeling any stretch and not sure I'm actually improving my mobility or helping fix the problem anyway. I'm not sure if there's something I'm missing technique-wise or if I've just got some sort of back issue that I've never noticed because I don't twist much in my day-to-day life?

Recently over the past few months I decided to try and read some information on the spiritual side of yoga, since I spend time everyday in these positions maybe I should know more about what it is beyond stretches and strengthening my body.   

This book has me asking myself so many questions and I am just about half way through it.

What is the best type of tshirt to wear for yoga? 

I started in a loose strappy gym top, which wasn’t suitable as I found it all wrapped around my sports bra and my bra on show. 

Following that I decided to wear an oversized normal tshirt, like others do in my class, which was better however it was still hanging quite low in certain poses and therefore annoying me. 

What is the best type of tshirt to wear that’s not going to get in my way? 

I do wear a sports bra underneath but I’d rather not wear anything cropped or just a sports bra because I’m overweight and I may not feel comfortable in it.
